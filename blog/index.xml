Today I’m going to post a little summary of my experience at the XPUGBg meetup I attended at the end of January. This time, the talk was “eXtreme Collaborative Codebase” by Alessio Coser.
What is a collaborative codebase? Alessio started his talk with a question: what does it mean to collaborate in a codebase for you? What does it take to do it? What are the practices we can use to “work well”?</description></item><item><title>A Case for Outside-In Design: Sandro Mancuso @ Tech Talks by eDreams ODIGEO</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/outside-in-design-edreams-meetup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 22:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/outside-in-design-edreams-meetup/</guid><description>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!
In my 2022 review, I said that one of my goals for 2023 was to participate more in communities (meetups, conferences and so on). Well, as a first step to achieving that goal, I attended a meetup hosted by eDreams ODIGEO (here) on January 24th.
For the inauguration of their Milan Hub, eDreams hosted Sandro Mancuso for his talk “A Case for Outside-In Design”, in which he proposes a set of practices and techniques to make business and technology meet when designing and extending a system.</description></item><item><title>My Experience at the Italian Agile Days 2022: Talks and Reflections</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-italian-agile-days/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-italian-agile-days/</guid><description>Hi 👋
Today’s post is about my experience at the Italian Agile Days 2022, which I attended in October 2022. I know, it’s way too late to write this, but I still think that remembering the talks I watched will be useful for others 😃.
The Italian Agile Days is a 2-day free conference held in a different city every year, in which people interested in agile practices (programmers and business people alike) gather to talk about agile and development practices.</description></item><item><title>2022: A Review</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/</guid><description>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!
Like every blogger out there, it’s time to write a “2022 Wrap-Up”! In this (short) post, I’ll give a recap of what happened last year, and write down my goals for 2023.
So, let’s start!
Disclaimer: This recap is mostly written by me and for me. I don’t expect it to be a beautifully written and engaging piece for other people. It might get boring, you’ve been warned.</description></item><item><title>XPUGBg December meetup: “Mars Rover Kata, an outside-in approach”</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/</guid><description>Hi! 👋
Today I will write about a meetup I attended this December, hosted by XPUGBg (Extreme Programming User Group Bergamo). The XPUGBg is an association promoting and organizing events related to extreme programming in the Bergamo region.
In this meetup, the guests (Marco Consolaro and Alessandro Di Gioia from Alcor Academy) performed a live mob programming session with the audience, to solve the mars rover kata. We learned how to do mob programming, and how the Outside-In TDD approach works.</description></item><item><title>Remote working?</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 18:36:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</guid><description>Hi! Welcome to my first post on this blog, I hope there will be others soon!
Today I felt inspired after reading an article from Bennet Garner (here). He writes every day in his newsletter about software development and finding purpose in your job/life. I’ll try to follow his advice and write regularly, but for sure I cannot promise anything like a daily post.
By the way, Bennet’s article is about remote working: its pros, cons and why it’s going to last in our society.</description></item></channel></rss>
