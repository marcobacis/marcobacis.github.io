          <p>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>As a wise man said (forgot the name), &ldquo;Frustration is the mother of innovation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For one of my projects at work, I needed to query and sort some tables. The requirement was to let the user filter and sort the data on any field.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect was that some fields were <code>enum</code> values under the hood&hellip;. how should I filter/sort these values, when the user searches using their text representation (and, even more difficult, translated in their language)?</p>
<p>In this post, I will show how I solved this issue with a nice, little utility function. Since our projects are in .NET, the solution leverages EF Core, Automapper and the power of C# Expression trees.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start!</p>
<h2 id="what-we-are-trying-to-do">What we are trying to do</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an example. This is the entity we&rsquo;re going to query:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> Status {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	Created,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	PaymentSuccessful,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	PaymentFailed,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	Shipped,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	Delivered
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Order</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> Id { <span style="color:#66d9ef">get</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">set</span>; }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#75715e">// ... other fields</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> Status CurrentStatus { <span style="color:#66d9ef">get</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">set</span>; }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Our goal is to present the user with a list of the orders in the system. The user wants to search the list using a generic query (e.g. an input text) and sort the values based on their <strong>text representation</strong>. Yes, also for our <code>Status</code> field!</p>
<p>This is a nightmare if the application is translated into multiple languages. Our application will have to filter the records not based on the enum&rsquo;s description, but on its translation.</p>
<p>For example, the user might type &ldquo;Shi&rdquo; and we should return only the orders with status <code>Shipped</code> if he speaks english. In other languages, the status will have a different translation (e.g. in italian it will be &ldquo;Spedito¨) which doesn´t match with the query.</p>
<p>When dealing with localization, the first option we have is to deal with it on the frontend. We create some json files with the correct translations and apply them to the UI. While this could be an option to visualize the data, it becomes more difficult when querying it.</p>
<p>Another option would be to select the correct value on the frontend using the translated text, then sen its original (numeric) representation to the backend.</p>
<p>In our case, we&rsquo;d like to search on multiple fields, which makes this approach more complex. Also, I wanted to expose a standard interface to the frontend (see below), so we&rsquo;ll see the backend-only solution!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the endpoint I came up with. It&rsquo;s implemented using <em>.NET 8 Minimal APIs</em> and <em>Entity Framework Core</em>. I also used <a href="https://alirezanet.github.io/Gridify/"  target="_blank" >Gridify</a> to <em>automagically</em> apply filtering, sorting and paging to the data.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>            <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> count = <span style="color:#66d9ef">await</span> ordersQuery

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ).WithName(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;GetOrders&#34;</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, we get the data inside the Orders table and project it to the final response type. I do this before performing the search/sort to filter based on what the user can see (e.g. our localized enum description, we&rsquo;ll see later).</p>
<p>Then, we use gridify to apply the paging/filtering/sorting to our query and return the data and the total count (so that the frontend can use it to display a list or table).</p>
<p>Seems simple, right? It is! However, if I try to search for some enum values (this can be done by sending a gridify query such as <code>'status = Created'</code>) I get a nasty error from the ORM, saying it cannot translate our code to a SQL query.</p>
<p>Why does this happen, and how can we fix that?</p>
<h2 id="how-automapper-queryable-extensions-work">How automapper queryable extensions work</h2>
<p>Automapper is an object-to-object mapper. It allows to define custom profiles to map any type of object to any other type. In our case, we use automapper to project the entity to the response we want the API to return.</p>
<p>We do this by using automapper&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.automapper.org/en/stable/Queryable-Extensions.html"  target="_blank" >Queryable extensions</a>. Queryable extensions allow to call the <code>ProjectTo</code> method on a LINQ query. Automapper adds a custom <code>SELECT</code> statement to our query, with the minimum set of fields needed for the mapping to occur. This optimization improves performance by passing less data from the DBMS to the application and also makes our code more readable.</p>
<h4 id="mapping-profile">Mapping profile</h4>
<p>To make automapper work, we need to define a mapping profile for our objects. Usually, automapper maps fields with the same name and type in both objects, making it easier to map simple objects with less code. For more complex mappings, we can provide a custom profile using some configuration methods.</p>
<p>For each complex field we want to map, we provide an <code>Expression</code> that maps that field from the source object. This expression can be simple (e.g. accessing a source field) or more complex (e.g. making operations on top, with conditionals and other procedures).</p>
<p>This is an example of a complex mapping, in which we map the total price of our order to the sum of the prices of each item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>CreateMap&lt;Order, OrderDto&gt;()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	.ForMember(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>		dst =&gt; dst.TotalPrice,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>		opt.MapFrom(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>			src =&gt; src.Items.Select(o =&gt; o.Price * o.Quantity).Sum()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>		)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The parameter we pass to the <code>MapFrom</code> method is a lambda, which is interpreted by the C# SDK as an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/"  target="_blank" >Expression Tree</a>.</p>
<p>Let´s see what are C# expressions, and how they are used.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-c-expression-trees">What are C# <code>Expression</code> trees?</h3>
<p>We just saw that automapper uses expressions to map fields between objects. But what are expressions in C#? Here is a short section to describe what is a C# <code>Expression</code> and how they are used in some libraries. To know more about expressions, see the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/"  target="_blank" >documentation</a></p>
<p>In layman&rsquo;s terms, an expression tree is a data structure (a tree) which stores a piece of code. In C#, we can define an expression starting from a lambda (such as <code>Func&lt;&gt;</code>). The compiler will parse the code inside our lambda and return the corresponding syntax tree.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how a lambda is expressed using an expression tree:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Expression&lt;Func&lt;<span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span>&gt;&gt; lambda = n =&gt; n + <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// Same as writing</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> parameter = Expression.Parameter(<span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span>), <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;n&#34;</span>);  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> constant = Expression.Constant(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>);  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> addition = Expression.Add(parameter, constant);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> lambda = Expression.Lambda&lt;Func&lt;<span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span>&gt;&gt;(addition, parameter);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What are expressions used for? The most common use case is in ORM frameworks. For example, Entity Framework can transform a chain of LINQ calls into SQL queries because each operation can be represented with an Expression.</p>
<p>For example, in this code</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>dbContext.Set&lt;Order&gt;().Where(o =&gt; o.Id == <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>).ToList()
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>o =&gt; o.Id == 3</code> is an expression. After creating the underlying <code>IQueryable</code>, EF will traverse the expression tree to optimize it and translate it to SQL. Cool!</p>
<p>Another example is automapper itself. A mapping profile can be created using expressions, to indicate how a given field should be mapped from the source object. When the profile is created, the expression is then used to map the given types. And that&rsquo;s what we are going to use for our use case!</p>
<h3 id="how-resource-files-work-in-net">How resource files work in .NET</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a small detour from automapper and its magic, to see how localization works in .NET.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/resources"  target="_blank" >Resource files</a> have been in the .NET framework since its inception. Basically, a resource file is an XML file (with <code>.resx</code> extension) in which we can put any static data we might need.</p>
<p>Before compilation, a program (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/resgen-exe-resource-file-generator"  target="_blank" >resgen</a>) converts these files to source code, which is embedded in the application&rsquo;s assembly and accessed from our code.</p>
<p>In the case of localization, we create a <code>.resx</code> file for every culture we support in our application (for example, <code>EnumTranslations.resx</code> for the default language, <code>EnumTranslations.it.resx</code> for Italian and so on). Each entry is in this format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;data name=<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Status_Created&#34;</span> xml:space=<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;preserve&#34;</span>&gt;  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#66d9ef">value</span>&gt;Created&lt;/<span style="color:#66d9ef">value</span>&gt;  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/data&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To enable localization in the app, we add this code in our <code>Program.cs</code>, configuring the path the compiler uses to find the resource files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>builder.Services.AddLocalization(options =&gt; options.ResourcesPath = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Resources&#34;</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/localization"  target="_blank" >Under the hood</a>, this line of code registers the services required to get the localized strings from the resource files. In addition to automatic culture detection by .NET (which works both on desktop/console and web applications!), this allows to transparently translate strings.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-custom-expression-to-translate-enums">Creating a custom expression to translate enums</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to our use case and write the mapper for our API. Let´s focus on the enum mapping.</p>
<p>As explained in the previous section, we put the translations in a resx file (<code>EnumTranslations.resx</code>) . To set a convention, let&rsquo;s say each item is in the form <code>&lt;Enum_Name&gt;_&lt;Enum_Value&gt;</code>, so our status enum will have the following fields generated for us:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>EnumTranslations.Status_Created,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EnumTranslations.Status_PaymentSuccessful,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EnumTranslations.Status_PaymentFailed,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EnumTranslations.Status_Shipped,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>EnumTranslations.Status_Delivered
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How can we use these fields in our mapping? Unfortunately, C# <code>Expression</code>s have a lot of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/#limitations"  target="_blank" >limitations</a> and, together with LINQ-specific limits (explained <a href="https://docs.automapper.org/en/stable/Queryable-Extensions.html#supported-mapping-options"  target="_blank" >here</a>) this means that these operations are not allowed (they won´t be translated to SQL):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>if</code> statements</li>
<li>External classes/methods calls</li>
<li>Dictionary access (not even if immutable) to get the right translation</li>
<li><code>switch/case</code> statements to select the right translation</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried many approaches, but the only one I found was to create a cascade of ternary operators to select the correct translation&hellip; here&rsquo;s the mapping for our status field:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>CreateMap&lt;Order, OrderResponse&gt;()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	.ForMember(dst =&gt; dst.Status,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>		opt =&gt; opt.MapFrom(src =&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>			src.Status = Status.Created ? EnumTranslations.Status_Created :
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>			src.Status = Status.PaymentSuccessful ? EnumTranslations.Status_PaymentSuccessful :
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>			src.Status = Status.PaymentFailed ? EnumTranslations.Status_PaymentFailed :
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>			src.Status = Status.Shipped ? EnumTranslations.Status_Shipped :
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>			src.Status = Status.Delivere ? EnumTranslations.Status_Delivered :
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>			src.Status.ToString())
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code has some issues we want to fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>It might become duplicated among multiple mapping profiles</li>
<li>It needs to be updated to incorporate new enum values</li>
<li>If the enum has a lot of values there il will be a lot of conditions&hellip;what happens if there is a typo or some parentheses are missed in the expression?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we&rsquo;ll see how to generate this expression automatically, to prevent errors and make it reusable in multiple mappings and for any kind of enum.</p>
<h2 id="automating-the-process">Automating the process</h2>
<p>The code we implemented above is quite ugly, and here comes the goal of this post: provide a generic method to map enum to (translated) strings without writing all those ternary expressions by hand.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the resulting extension class, with a method that can be applied to any expression accessing an enum:</p>

<p>It then gathers all the enum values and constructs the cascade of ternary operators to access all the resource file properties. For each value, we generate the three arguments to the ternary operator:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The condition (<code>enumValueExpression</code>)</p>
<pre><code>input value == enum value
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the condition is true, we return the translated string</p>
<pre><code>EnumTranslations.&lt;Enum-Name&gt;_&lt;Enum_Value&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, we go ahead with the other conditions in the chain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The method  has some rough edges, for example;</p>
<ul>
<li>it gives a generic &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; default value if the enum value is invalid</li>
<li>It needs to be given the type of the class generated from the resx file</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with its drawbacks, we are now able to generate the mapping profile easily!</p>
<p>In my project I added another extension method, to make the generator more specific. The method automatically adds the <code>EnumTranslations</code> type to the call:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">EnumMappingExtensions</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>		);  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And voilà! Now the mapping profile can be easily written like this:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	    opt =&gt; opt.MapFromTranslatedEnum(src =&gt; src.Status)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	);
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for today!</p>
<p>In this post, I showed how automapper allows to easily project entities with its queryable extension. In particular, we saw how to translate enum values in their correct language using a nice extension method. I hope this will prove useful to other C# developers out there!</p>
<p>See you!</p>
<p>PS. I left the example code (with a different entity and enum names, called <code>MyEntity</code> and <code>MyEnum</code>) on <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/dotnet-enum-translation-expression-example/"  target="_blank" >github</a>.</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to the usual end-of-year recap! Right before Christmas, I take some time to reflect on the year that has passed, and write some observations here on the blog (<a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/"  target="_blank" >2022</a>, <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-review/"  target="_blank" >2023</a>).</p>
<p>This time it&rsquo;s not different, so let&rsquo;s start!</p>
<h2 id="2024-goals-review">2024 Goals Review</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a brief review of the goals I set for myself for 2024:</p>
<h4 id="-write-more">❌ Write more</h4>
<p>The first goal I set for 2024 was to write more on this blog, and in particular to focus more on programming (less journals and reviews, more code)!</p>
<p>In 2024, I wrote 9 post&hellip;less than 2023! Definitely didn&rsquo;t reach the &ldquo;1 post every two weeks&rdquo; I set as goal at the beginning of 2024.</p>
<h4 id="-exercise">✅ Exercise</h4>
<p>This year I focused more on exercising than last year. I regularly (2 times a week) went to a gym (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/performa_bg/"  target="_blank" >@performa</a>), lost 5kg and in general led a healthier lifestyle than before. I didn&rsquo;t reach 85kg or less yet, but I still think this is a win!</p>
<p>For next year, I will focus more on health, maybe increasing my gym attendance to 3 times a week + a short run once in a while (to get some fresh air instead of the sweaty one at the gym 😅).</p>
<h4 id="-speak-somewhere">❌ Speak somewhere</h4>
<p>In 2023 I attended a lot of conferences and meetups. This inspired me to set a goal for 2024 to &ldquo;speak somewhere&rdquo;&hellip; which I didn&rsquo;t. Same thing as taking care of the blog, it takes creativity and constant work to keep a habit of writing or speaking, and I simply didn&rsquo;t put effort into this.</p>
<p>I hope this will change in 2025! I still have no ideas for a talk, but I hope that putting more effort into the blog will bring some ideas for talks too! I also plan on attending more &ldquo;unconferece&rdquo;-style events in order to practice speaking, even without an agenda or a talk ready.</p>
<h4 id="-learn-across-the-stack">✅ Learn across the stack</h4>
<p>I definitely learnt a lot in 2024. Spoiler: I set this goal right after starting my new job at <a href="https://www.zupit.it/"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>, so I knew there will be learning involved.</p>
<p>In 2024, I extended my knowledge of C#/.NET and learned to work on the frontend too, with Angular. I also refreshed my knowledge of CSS (more on that on a blog post, maybe&hellip;) and learned a bit of mobile development with flutter (the project got canceled before starting, but I still prepared with a course on Dart and Flutter 😁).</p>
<h4 id="-attend-conferences-and-meetups">✅ Attend conferences and meetups</h4>
<p>Attending conferences and meetups was an easy goal I set for myself for 2024 to force me to get out of the house and meet people. And it worked 😅! I attended a lot of events (maybe less than 2023, but still more than I expected). More on that later.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Time for a proper review of 2024! Let&rsquo;s start from work.</p>
<p>I left <a href="https://e-novia.it/"  target="_blank" >e-Novia</a> in December 2023. Even if the job was interesting and involved a lot of learning across the entire stack (from firmware to web and even gaming) I wasn&rsquo;t ok with the policy around remote working and the overall &ldquo;slowness&rdquo; of the projects. We treated startups like standard consulting customers, with waterfall-like planning and a lot of rigidity. I was looking for a more &ldquo;agile&rdquo; company.</p>
<p>I looked for alternatives, and found <a href="https://zupit.it"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>, a small consultancy from Trento focused on learning, continuous improvement and performance. The biggest perk that attracted me was Zupit part-time policy 😏: 30 hours/week and remote, what could I ask more? I could focus my newly-freed time on learning, improving myself and so on.</p>
<p>And I have a lot of free time now! Between the 10 hours of work saved, and the many more hours saved from commute (I was commuting daily, about 3 and half hours each day&hellip;) I have a lot of time to relax, study and have fun.</p>
<p>I invested part of this free time to improve myself. In 2023 I started going to the gym on saturday morning (the only time I could). In 2024 I started going 2 times a week in the afternoon, to save time on the weekend and stay with my family. I also plan to increase to 3 times a week 😎.</p>
<p>Another thing that I do with this time is learn. While before I would have studied during the commute or in the evening, now I have time to study in the afternoon. Right after entering Zupit I studied Angular, to catch up with what the team was using. I had never used the framework, so I had a lot to learn. After that, I dabbled a bit with Flutter, even I I still hadn&rsquo;t used it at work. Now, I have a list of technical books I want to read, along with keeping my Rust knowledge up-to-date, even if I might not use it for work right now.</p>
<p>Finally, the last thing I do with this time is&hellip;.relax. Not everything in life has to be done for a purpose, and I reject the idea that we should be all working all the time. I am definitely not competitive (in fact, I was never successful at sports), so sometimes I take time to relax by reading a good book, taking walks around the town (I discovered parks I didn&rsquo;t know existed) and doing things slower. Since I left my job in Milan, I noticed I&rsquo;ve become more calm and even slower in my movements and thoughts!!</p>
<p>In addition to working less, Zupit advocates for continuous improvement and learning. We work 6 hours a day, but to compensate that we need to be more productive and mindful during that time. During 2024, I learned how to focus more during work hours, and improved my productivity both because of this, and also thanks to the better developer experience we have in Zupit. (Most of) projects follow a standard format, we use the latest tools (e.g. jetbrains suite before it was free, chatgpt, copilot) and have a seamless deployment experience (mostly thanks to our Tech Leads and volunteers which keep the pipelines running 🥰).</p>
<p>I must say, I miss the office a bit. Trento is not so far from my hometown, but it&rsquo;s still more than 2 hours by car each way. In my previous job I advocated for full-remote work, but now this personal belief is starting to crack. Working alone in a room is not the same than working with others IRL, even with low-latency video calls and messages. Whenever I can, I look forward meeting with the team in person, but I think it doesn&rsquo;t happen often enough because of the cost this presents (for me, and for the company&hellip;hotels aren&rsquo;t free!).</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>My goal for 2024 was to write at least 20 posts, or even better to begin posting every two weeks. I definitely didn&rsquo;t reach that goal 😅.</p>
<p>This year I published 9 posts (+ this one you are reading):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-italian-agile-days/"  target="_blank" >My Experience at the Italian Agile Days 2023</a></li>

<li><a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/show-your-work-book/"  target="_blank" >Show your Work!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2024-polenta-and-deploy/"  target="_blank" >Polenta &amp; Deploy 2024</a></li>
<li><a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/load-balancer-rust-1/"  target="_blank" >Let&rsquo;s build a Load Balancer in Rust - Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/load-balancer-rust-2/"  target="_blank" >Let&rsquo;s build a Load Balancer in Rust - Part 2</a></li>

<li><a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2024-update-conference/"  target="_blank" >Update Conference 2024 Journal</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Two of them (IAD 2023 and &ldquo;Show your work&rdquo;) were actually written in part in 2023, so this brings the gran total to 7 new posts written in 2024&hellip;less than once a month!!</p>
<p>There are a lot of <del>excuses</del> reasons to explain why I didn&rsquo;t stay consistent during 2024: lack of ideas, impostor syndrome, personal committments (more on that in the <a href="#personal" >last section</a>). I think the most obvious reason is that I didn&rsquo;t put enough effort in this blog. I definitely had time to write (see the <a href="#work" >previous</a> section), but didn&rsquo;t find what I was doing at work interesting enough to be published, or didn&rsquo;t try to make it more interesting 😅.</p>
<p>I still had fun writing these posts. The three-part series on writing a load balancer in rust also landed on the <a href="https://this-week-in-rust.org/"  target="_blank" >This Week in Rust</a> newsletter (on <a href="https://www.marcoieni.com/"  target="_blank" >Marco Ieni</a>&rsquo;s advice, he forced me to propose the posts!). I really liked writing the load balancer and explaining in detail how I implemented it. It also was a lot of work! I kept changing the load balancer code while writing the posts. In the end, writing forced me to learn more about async Rust and to keep my code clean and clear for the audience, which is exactly why I think writing is the best way to learn a new concept.</p>
<p>Now, some spoiler for 2025: I just bought the book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/writing-for-developers"  target="_blank" >Writing for Developers</a>&rdquo; by Piotr Sarna and Cynthia Dunlop. I plan to read this right at the beginning of the year, to inspire me and get some tips and tricks on how to find post ideas and executing on them.</p>
<p>I also just finished reading <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/"  target="_blank" >Learning Domain-Driven Design</a> by Vlad Khononov, and plan to write a couple of posts with my summary (it will force me to re-read the book and get more out of it).</p>
<p>Finally, I plan to attend more conferences this year (see next <a href="#communities" >section</a>) and will probably write about my experience there 😉.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>This year I read significantly less than in 2023 (23 books instead of 28). This continues the trend from 2022 (32 -&gt; 28 -&gt; 23).</p>
<p>Since working remotely I noticed I am reading less books, and instead have increased my screen time. I suppose that commuting forced me to read rather than watch videos (both for the sound - the train can be very noisy - and for the bad connectivity in some areas). I hope to reverse this trend, resist the TV and smartphone and get back to reading more books next year!</p>
<p>BTW, here&rsquo;s the list of books I read this year (courtesy of my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22830084-marco-bacis"  target="_blank" >goodreads profile</a>):
<em>(Disclaimer: didn&rsquo;t want to translate the titles, so if I read the book in italian the title will also be in italian)</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>And here are some books I started in 2024, but didn&rsquo;t finish:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>From Objects to Functions</em> by Uberto Baldini</li>
<li><em>How to Read a Book</em> by Mortimer J. Adler</li>
<li><em>Lezioni di Fiducia per diffidenti</em> by Olga Chiaia</li>
<li><em>Terraform: Up and Running</em> by Yevgeniy Brikman</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for not finishing them, and most of all the book from Uberto (<em>From Objects to Functions</em>): I really enjoyed following the first chapters. Following along the book with the code (copying it) was not straightforward, and also my lack of knowledge in kotlin didn&rsquo;t help 😅. I still plan to read it in 2025, so you&rsquo;ll find it in the &ldquo;read&rdquo; list next year!</p>
<h2 id="communities">Communities</h2>
<p>This year I continued the trend started in 2023 of going to conferences and meetups near me. I love participating in these events, as they allow to both keep updated on new technologies and to meet new people and old friends.</p>
<p>Thanks to Zupit, this year I was also able to attend an international conference on .NET (spoiler: I already bought the ticket for next year 😝). It was a great way to breathe some international air, meet the Prague .NET community and update my knowledge of .NET and related stuff. I also <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2024-update-conference/"  target="_blank" >wrote</a> about the conference.</p>
<p>As usual, here&rsquo;s the list of conferences and meetups I attended in 2024
Conferences (and unconferences):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudgen.it/codegen-2024/"  target="_blank" >Codegen 2024</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Meetups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/xpug-bergamo/"  target="_blank" >XPUG Bergamo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/xpugtn/"  target="_blank" >XPUG Trento</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/ugidotnet/"  target="_blank" >.NET Italian User Group</a> (UGIdotNet)</li>
</ul>
<p>A nice addition to the list of meetups is the XPUG groups in Milan and Trento: while Milan is a destination near me, the Trento group was created this year, and I was able to participate to their meetups and also go the office the day before/after. Two birds with a stone!</p>
<p>For next year, I plan to attend at least the same events as 2024, with the addition of FOSDEM (as I did in <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-my-fosdem-experience/"  target="_blank" >2023</a>) and other Unconferences (like <a href="https://www.socrates-conference.it/"  target="_blank" >SoCraTes</a>), which I didn&rsquo;t attend this time because I was in another continent (🇯🇵, see below).</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h2>
<p>If 2023 was marked by a sad news (Lucky 😭), 2024 had a really positive event.</p>
<p>In December 2023, given my new free time, I took some time to find a nice ring. In February, I bit the bullet and finally proposed to my girlfriend, so&hellip;we got married in October 💍!</p>

<p>Right after the wedding, we departed for a 3 week trip to Japan. I had already been there in 2023, but it was nothing compared to our honeymoon! We visited Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo with short trips to Nagoya (where we visited my favorite place: the <a href="https://museum.jr-central.co.jp/en/"  target="_blank" >Japan Rail Museum</a>!!), Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, Takayama and Hakone (a fantastic hot spring area, with a terrible traffic).</p>
<p>Japan was wonderful, and I cannot wait to go there again 😍</p>

<h2 id="2025-goals">2025 Goals</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for the &ldquo;Marco dreams up impossible goals to set for next year&rdquo; section!
After careful considerations, here they are:</p>
<h4 id="write-more">Write more</h4>
<p>Last year I made a goal of writing every two weeks on this blog. This time I won&rsquo;t commit to a specific cadence. However, the goal is to write more freely on the blog, without listening too much to the impostor living in my brain.</p>
<p>Is the content original/advanced/deep enough? Will someone care? Will I get any reads? Am I exposing how smart I am, how much I know?</p>
<p>These are all thoughts and questions that I will have to ignore while writing. Simple! Whenever I see something interesting, I&rsquo;ll write here, even if it ends up being a 3-lines post.</p>
<h4 id="more-exercise">More exercise</h4>
<p>This year I was able to exercise two times a week by going to a personal trainer. Time to take off the training wheels and subscribe to a public gym!</p>
<p>The goal is to exercise at least 3 times a week, either with the personal trainer or without. Also, I should lose some fat, getting to around 80kgs&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="contribute-to-open-source">Contribute to Open Source</h4>
<p>Last year I attended the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-Saturday-Milano/"  target="_blank" >Open Source Saturday Milano</a> event to force me to contribute to any OS project. I did it, but with a lot of hand-holding and help from the folks there. Also, I didn&rsquo;t continue contributing to the projects I saw there.</p>
<p>For 2025 this needs to change. Contributing to Open Source is a great way to give back something to the community, to learn new technology and in general to have fun. I hope to find at least one project and actively contribute to it!</p>
<h4 id="publish-a-videotalk">Publish a Video/Talk</h4>
<p>This is the third time I promise to create more content, so it better be the last one I promise, and the first time I actually deliver.</p>
<p>In December I tried live-streaming while solving some Advent Of Code challenges (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@marcobacis-dev"  target="_blank" >here</a> is the channel). The first time I was anxious and did a lot of errors, while the following days were easier.</p>
<p>Live-streaming is an easy way to show myself in public without too much background work (such as editing). The goal for 2025 is to keep streaming (e.g. try solving other challenges, maybe streaming while contributing to a project or learning a new technology). This fits with the <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public"  target="_blank" >Learn in Public</a> goal I had two years ago.</p>
<p>Another evergreen goal is to give a talk somewhere 😅 we&rsquo;ll see how that goes, as I fist need to find something interesting to talk about (can you hear the impostor talking?).</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all! 2024 was great. I learned a lot, met new people, traveled and also had one the most important moments in my life.</p>
<p>I hope 2025 will be even better, so let&rsquo;s start it with a smile and a lot of good intentions (not forgetting the effort and work to make it happen)!!</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi! Welcome to a new post 👋 .</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since the last time I wrote on the blog (June  🥶). I had a lot to do during the summer (had to organise my wedding 💍) and didn&rsquo;t find inspiration to write. I promise I&rsquo;ll be more active from now on 😁.</p>
<p>BTW, let&rsquo;s get right into business.</p>
<p>I just got back from <a href="https://www.updateconference.net/"  target="_blank" >Update Conference</a> in Prague! Update is a conference focused on .NET and related technologies (all in Microsoft salsa).</p>
<p>The idea to go there came to my Tech Leader (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarmuscatello/"  target="_blank" >Omar</a>) even before joining <a href="https://www.zupit.it/"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a> last year. Given that we use .NET a lot, we decided to go there with the entire team! This served both as a learning experience, and as a way to get together. Working remotely can feel lonely sometimes, so why not have a beer in Prague, and learn something at the same time?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of my experience in Prague.</p>
<h3 id="day-one">Day One</h3>
<p>Day one started with a great breakfast offered by the conference organisers. In general, food was plenty for the entirety of the event (breakfast, lunch and even an happy hour included!).</p>
<p>I had a lot for breakfast, then the talks started. Here they are!</p>
<h4 id="entire-stack-c-al-rodriguezhttpsprogrammeralcom">Entire Stack C# (<a href="https://programmeral.com/"  target="_blank" >Al Rodriguez</a>)</h4>
<p>Al showed the audience how it&rsquo;s possible to build, deploy and test (e2e) an application using (mostly) .NET, in a real &ldquo;full&rdquo; stack scenario!</p>
<p>We are now used to building full-stack applications in .NET (at least, some people do&hellip;not me 😅), but Al showed us how to extend the stack to include even DevOps tasks (build, deploy and test). The industry standard is to use multiple tools which use yaml&hellip;but yaml is an ugly language, so why don&rsquo;t we use our strongest skill (.NET) to configure and run them?</p>
<p>During the talk, Al created a sample application in .NET (using Minimal API and Blazor). He then used <a href="https://cakebuild.net/"  target="_blank" >cake</a> and <a href="https://nuke.build/"  target="_blank" >nukebuild</a> to build the project, <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/"  target="_blank" >Pulumi</a> to deploy its infrastructure and <a href="https://playwright.dev/dotnet/"  target="_blank" >Playwright</a> to test the deployed application.</p>
<p>I really liked the concept behind the talk, even if I don&rsquo;t agree with using .NET on the entire stack. I think that having diverse tools and a clear separation between them is better than doing everything in the same environment (looking at you, javascript!). In fact, in Zupit we decided to use terraform instead of Pulumi for exactly this reason.</p>
<h4 id="basic-designs-and-how-we-got-them-wrong-adam-furmanekhttpsadamfurmanekpl">Basic Designs and How We Got Them Wrong (<a href="https://adamfurmanek.pl/"  target="_blank" >Adam Furmanek</a>)</h4>
<p>In his talk, Adam started from basic constructs of programming languages and design patterns, and destroyed them!</p>
<p>First, he started with the Liskov Substitution principle. He explained it, then drilled down on the example that Wikipedia gives (which is slightly wrong w.r.t the definition). Basically, the Liskov principle seems to be applied to properties of a <strong>type</strong>, but instead we should intend it applied to the <strong>behaviour</strong> of a component! Adam insisted that we should document this in contracts (in particular in documentation). I agree, and I add that this properties should be specified and enforced in unit tests!</p>
<p>After that, he listed a lot of constructs we use daily, and proceeded to destroy them: he talked about dependency inversion, inheritance, DRY principles and, most of all, function <em>coloring</em> and async. He mostly showed examples using C#, but the opinions can be extended to any language employing these patterns.</p>
<h4 id="interlude-table-soccer-and-talking-with-people">Interlude: table soccer and talking with people</h4>
<p>This is not a talk summary 😁</p>
<p>The great thing about in-presence events is the opportunity to meet and talk with people you don&rsquo;t know, and wouldn&rsquo;t even have the chance to meet when at home or at the office. This was the case for me at this conference!</p>
<p>Right after lunch, we started playing the table soccer (kindly offered by one of the sponsors, <a href="https://www.riganti.cz/en"  target="_blank" >Riganti</a>). After enjoying our time there, we had the chance to stop at the Microsoft booth, and met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vzaritovsky/"  target="_blank" >Vlad Zarytovskii</a>.</p>
<p>Vlad is lead the F# compiler and tooling team lead. He introduced us to the Microsoft team in Prague (with some italians, like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcorossignoli/"  target="_blank" >Marco</a>) and we talked about work in Prague, how Microsoft participates in developer events, and I discovered he worked on some rust projects at Microsoft 🤩. Definitely a great person to know.</p>
<p>This was a nice encounter during the talks, and for me that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s worth to participate at this kind of events, even if they seem expensive and useless for some companies. I skipped some talks, but got something even better in exchange.</p>
<h4 id="closing-the-loop-instrumenting-your-applications-with-opentelemetry-alex-thissenhttpsgithubcomalexthissen">Closing the loop: instrumenting your applications with OpenTelemetry (<a href="https://github.com/alexthissen"  target="_blank" >Alex Thissen</a>)</h4>
<p>In the aftrenoon, I was able to attend only one session, and Alex gave a great introduction to OpenTelemetry in .NET. OpenTelemetry is a protocol to expose observability signals from our services.</p>
<p>Alex explained the main signals that we can expose from an application (traces, logs and metrics) and showed how the OpenTelemetry libraries allows to expose these signals easily from our .NET application. I already knew about logs and metrics (used prometheus some time ago), and really liked the introduction to tracing and how easily we can add it to .NET (in a transparent way too!).</p>
<h3 id="day-two">Day Two</h3>
<p>Time for day two! This time, I tried to eat less for breakfast 😅. Strong from the previous day of talks, the goal was to attend most of them without playing at the table soccer in the break room.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<h4 id="net-aspire-the-new-way-to-be-cloud-native-with-net-isaac-levinhttpswwwisaaclevincom">.NET Aspire: The new way to be cloud native with .NET (<a href="https://www.isaaclevin.com/"  target="_blank" >Isaac Levin</a>)</h4>
<p>To start the second day, I attended an introduction on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview"  target="_blank" >.NET Aspire</a> by Isaac Levin. In his talk, he showed what Aspire is, how to run a small project with it, and the wonders of the aspire dashboard.</p>
<p>Aspire is a set of &ldquo;developer productivity&rdquo; tools, allowing to ease the development of distributed applications. In particular, it allows to orchestrate multiple services <em>locally</em> (e.g. developing an application which uses PostgreSQL, Redis and other services) and to deploy them <em>remotely</em> (for now on Azure) using only .NET.</p>
<p>One thing I found interesting from Isaac&rsquo;s talk is the Aspire Dashboard, which allows to collect telemetry signals and monitor our application and related services in a single click with a pre-configured container.</p>
<p>I still think that it&rsquo;s better to keep deployment tools and languages separated from the application code (see the talk above) to keep responsabilities separated, and to enable collaboration among teams with different tech stacks.</p>
<p>Anyway, Aspire was interesting. I think it might be useful as a scaffolding tool for new projects, as it allows to run locally an entire distributed application with fewer lines of code.</p>
<h4 id="let-none-survive-how-to-test-our-unit-tests-with-mutation-testing-stefan-polzhttpsgithubcomflash0ver">Let none survive! How to test our unit tests with mutation testing (<a href="https://github.com/Flash0ver"  target="_blank" >Stefan Polz</a>)</h4>
<p>Testing is a fundamental practice in software development (even more if done before writing production code&hellip;TDD anyone?). But how can we be sure that our tests are working correctly, that our code is thoroughly tested?</p>
<p>Enter the world of Mutation testing!! Stefan showed how mutation testing works, and how we can easily integrate it in our application development using <a href="https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/introduction/"  target="_blank" >Stryker</a>.</p>
<p>I really liked the introduction to mutation testing, and even more the live demo he gave on a sample code. I think mutation testing is a valid addition to our projects. For most applications it might be overkill  (at least in projects I worked on), but it can be useful for &ldquo;safety critical&rdquo; environments (e.g. firmware, medical, defence, aerospace and so on) and for library code, which might be used in wildly different scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="15-years-of-insights-from-a-tdd-practicioner-dennis-doomenhttpswwwdennisdoomencom">15 years of insights from a TDD practicioner (<a href="https://www.dennisdoomen.com/"  target="_blank" >Dennis Doomen</a>)</h4>
<p>Dennis gave a lot of advice on how to make TDD work for you, given his 30 of experience in the field (he&rsquo;s the author of <a href="https://fluentassertions.com/"  target="_blank" >FluentAssertions</a>, which is widely used to write tests afterall!).</p>
<p>I wrote down all his bullet points on a paper notebook, but I&rsquo;m not going to write all of them here, just some concepts I found interesting.</p>
<p>The first is the concept of <em>Unit</em>. In most books and courses, unit testing refers to unit as the single class which should be put under test. Dennis instead recommends to test the outside behaviour of the system (which in some cases is called contract testing), so the unit is usually wider than a single class! The scope of a test should be an entire module (or slice in the case of vertical slicing).</p>
<p>Another interesting advice is to make tests explicit, as they represent the &ldquo;specification&rdquo; of our software. As the agile manifesto says, &ldquo;working code over comprehensive documentation&rdquo;. In the case of TDD, the code is most of the documentation and specification (if it&rsquo;s not written on a test, then it shouldn&rsquo;t happen!), so tests should emphasize the behaviour of the system. Here he talked about naming, expressivity and structure of the tests.</p>
<p>Finally, Dennis recommended to expand the scope of the tests outside the core business logic, integrating the database (without touching it directly from the tests, be aware!) and not employing mocks more than necessary, to test the entire behaviour of the system from the perspective of the user. I agree with his reccomendation, even if sometimes I would like to write smaller tests for some logic of my applications (testing the entire API and database can sometimes be really slow, both in development and in build times).</p>
<p>As always when talking about processes and methodologies, most of the advice has to be taken in the context of each project and team. Most of the bullet points he discussed where contrasting. As developers, it&rsquo;s our work to find the right tradeoffs, while sometimes we can be more &ldquo;dogmatic&rdquo; if we think something is important (e.g. we cannot skip testing at all, but at least we can play with the definition of what a &ldquo;unit&rdquo; is).</p>
<h4 id="lets-design-a-new-c-language-feature-jared-parsonshttpsblogparanoidcodingorg">Let&rsquo;s design a new C# language feature (<a href="https://blog.paranoidcoding.org/"  target="_blank" >Jared Parsons</a>)</h4>
<p>Jared is the C# compiler lead at Microsoft, so he&rsquo;s the real deal when talking about C# features. In his (first, for today) talk, he told the story of a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; C# feature: variable length argument with <code>IEnumerable</code> instead of an array.</p>
<p>Basically, for most of .NET history, if you wanted a variable number of arguments to a method, you would do so by defining an array with the <code>params</code> modifier, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> method(<span style="color:#66d9ef">params</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span>[] multipleParams) {}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But why does the param needs to be an array, and not any other collection type?</p>
<p>Jared explained why, and how they were finally able to add this feature in .NET 9. Most of the time the feature was low priority (because of the difficulty of implementing it, keeping the compiler retro-compatible and without real users concerns). In the end, the right moment came with the introduction of <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-13.0/params-collections"  target="_blank" >Params collections</a> in C# 12, which made the feature &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; to implement (somewhat).</p>
<p>The story told by Jared highlighted how most of the times what technical people want is not aligned with what the business (and clients) want, but with a happy ending this time!! He also explained how the C# compiler team always thinks about developer experience (for example, why is <code>Select</code> at the end and not at the beginning of a LINQ expression? To allow intellisense to work out the type of the collection and suggest the right methods and types afterward!).</p>
<p>Finally, watching someone talk about language design and compiler features is always interesting, even if I don&rsquo;t understand most of it 😅.</p>
<h4 id="exploring-source-generators-in-net-jared-parsonshttpsblogparanoidcodingorg">Exploring Source Generators in .NET (<a href="https://blog.paranoidcoding.org/"  target="_blank" >Jared Parsons</a>)</h4>
<p>The final talk I watched was again from Jared. This time, he gave an introduction to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/#source-generators"  target="_blank" >source generators</a>.</p>
<p>Source generators leverage the C# compiler api to allow <em>compile-time metaprogramming</em>, based on the source code informations given by the compiler. The system is also integrated with IDEs, so it allows to seamlessly compile generated code without the developer intervention. They are really useful and are mostly used in frameworks for mapping, serialization and other boilerplate code (e.g. ORMs).</p>
<p>Jared highlighted the main advantages of source generators w.r.t. systems previously based on msbuild (e.g. razor, wpf, vsix and so on) which need to use intermediate projects/assemblies to work. Source generators allow to work without these limitations, but introduce additional complexity given the incremental nature of modern compilers (e.g. can only generate new files, cannot interact with other generators and are not applied with a given order/priority).</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this talk, as it shows a feature most of us won&rsquo;t directly use in our projects, but are already using without realizing it!</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this conference! I really enjoyed my time in Prague. We had fun, got updated on the latest .NET features, discovered new ways of working (e.g. with Aspire, Source Generators and with mutation testing) and most of all, met new people.</p>
<p>I never attended a conference solely centered around .NET, and I think that specialized conferences can be a good source of knowledge and a great way to know people in the (not so small) community of your favourite programming language or framework.</p>
<p>That said, I hope to attend next year event, so see you there!</p>

<p>Hi  👋 welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>This is the third (and last?) part of the series &ldquo;let&rsquo;s build a load balancer in rust&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/load-balancer-rust-1/"  target="_blank" >first post</a> we saw how to forward a single request to an upstream server, using <a href="https://actix.rs/"  target="_blank" >Actix</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/"  target="_blank" >Reqwest</a>. Then, we implemented a simple round-robin strategy in the <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/load-balancer-rust-2/"  target="_blank" >second post</a> .</p>
<p>In this last part, we are going to integrate a simple health check into our load balancer, to avoid sending requests to unavailable upstream servers!</p>
<h2 id="simplifying-the-round-robin-policy">Simplifying the Round-Robin policy</h2>
<p>As already done in part 2, let&rsquo;s start with some small chores in our code from the previous post. I hope this shows that even when writing and being careful during development, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement.</p>
<p>The small refactoring we are going to do is related to the round-robin policy code, in particular how we increment the counter. In the previous post, I implemented the policy update in this way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">async</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">fn</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">next</span>(<span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span>self, _request: <span style="color:#66d9ef">&amp;</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">HttpRequest</span>) -&gt; String {

I didn&rsquo;t use her solution for waiting multiple futures, because I wanted to also collect all the results of the operations. Instead, I found the useful <a href="https://docs.rs/futures-preview/latest/i686-pc-windows-msvc/futures/future/fn.join_all.html"  target="_blank" >join_all</a> method in the futures crate, which is exactly what I needed for the task!</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What is the difference from the implementation we did last time?</p>
<p>While in part 2 the <code>backends</code> variable was readonly (initialised at the beginning of the program), now the list of available servers can change at runtime, based on the healthcheck results. But our policy might be used concurrently, and rust doesn&rsquo;t allow concurrent access to <code>Vec</code> (also, our vector was immutable).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"  target="_blank" >RwLock</a> allows us to read and mutate the backends vector in a thread-safe way. It does so by keeping a lock on the resource (the <code>Vec&lt;Backend&gt;</code>) but in an <em>asymmetric</em> way. In fact, it&rsquo;s possible to have multiple readers at the same time, but whenever a writer wants to mutate the resource (e.g. us, when we receive the healthcheck results), it gets exclusive access.</p>
<h3 id="integrating-everything-together">Integrating everything together</h3>
<p>Now that we have both the polling mechanism and the upgraded policy, it&rsquo;s time to integrate the two and finally make the acceptance test pass!</p>
<p>What we need to do is to periodically call the <code>get_healthy_backends</code> method and forward its results to the policy.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a nice discussion on how to use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/channels.html"  target="_blank" >channels</a> to communicate among multiple tasks/thread, but I ended up simplifying the code and using a single task 🥲 here it is:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all! Now the test pass, and we have just added a healthcheck procedure to our load balancer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>We have implemented a simple HTTP load balancer, with a round-robin policy and healthcheck procedure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s missing?</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, I didn&rsquo;t include config management, command line arguments and error management. All of this is left as exercise for the reader (you can find the entire project on the <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/coding-challenges/tree/main/load_balancer"  target="_blank" >repo</a>).</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t implement other features needed by HTTP load balancers, such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For"  target="_blank" >X-Forwarded-For</a> and all additional headers. Finally, I don&rsquo;t know which version of HTTP this balancer supports (probably 1.1? I don&rsquo;t know). Basically, this was a nice exercise with async rust, but cannot be considered in any way to be production (or even test) ready!</p>
<p>I hope you still had fun and found the articles interesting. I certainly learned a lot in implementing this simple challenge, and hope to do more in the future!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, and see you next time 👋</p>

<p>Hi  👋 welcome to a new post! This is the second part of the series &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s build a Load Balancer in rust&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/load-balancer-rust-1/"  target="_blank" >first post</a> we saw how to forward a single request to an upstream server, using <a href="https://actix.rs/"  target="_blank" >Actix</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/"  target="_blank" >Reqwest</a>.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;ll see how to implement a round-robin policy, to forward our requests to multiple backends!</p>
<h2 id="small-fix-in-the-handler">Small fix in the handler</h2>
<p>In the first part, we left a (small) code smell in the handler code, because we instantiate the <code>reqwest</code> client struct on each new request received:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> client <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Client::new();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The fix is simple: we can add the client to the shared app data, and then use it inside the handler! In this way, we won&rsquo;t have to istantiate the client on every request. This is also explained in reqwest <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/struct.Client.html"  target="_blank" >docs</a>: &ldquo;The <code>Client</code> holds a connection pool internally, so it is advised that you create one and <strong>reuse</strong> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried adding the client directly to the <code>LoadBalancer</code> struct without passing through Actix, but the compiler complained when defining the handler and I just left it as-is. If you know a better method, write a comment at the end of the post (or even better, create a PR on the <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/coding-challenges/tree/main/load_balancer"  target="_blank" >project repository</a> 😁).</p>
<h2 id="waiting-for-the-load-balancer-to-start">Waiting for the Load Balancer to start</h2>
<p>Before starting with the round-robin implementation, lets tidy up a bit the code from the first part. The first thing to do is to improve the test we wrote!</p>
<p>In the test, we create the load balancer server and wait for it to start up with a simple `sleep´</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// The class under test, the load balancer itself

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Well, let&rsquo;s fix this and create a function to wait for the server to start!</p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;ll assume that the load balancer is up when the web server itself starts. To do so, we can add a healthcheck endpoint simply with actix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// ...

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#75715e">// ...
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>To fix our test, we can wait for the healthcheck url to be available by trying multiple times and waiting for a 200 HTTP code. Here is an example function to do so:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With this method we can now replace the old <code>tokio::time::sleep</code>. Now we&rsquo;re ready to go on and start spamming multiple servers with our requests!</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-round-robin-policy">Creating a Round Robin Policy</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s finally time to forward our requests among multiple servers!</p>
<p>Up until now, we have &ldquo;decided&rdquo; the upstream host to which we forward our requests in the <code>handler</code> method of the load balancer, but I think we should delegate and isolate this responsibility to a different module, such as a <em>Routing Policy</em>.</p>
<p>While our tests are still passing, we can afford to perform some <em><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/preparatory-refactoring-example.html"  target="_blank" >preparatory refactoring</a></em>.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>next</code> method takes the request reference and returns the host on which the load balancer should forward the request. We declare as <code>async</code> method, to indicate that the policy might wait for some I/O or other async operations (e.g. accessing shared data on the server, using a db/cache).</p>
<p>Why the <code>#[async_trait]</code> macro on top of the trait? The <a href="https://docs.rs/async-trait/latest/async_trait/"  target="_blank" >async_trait</a> crate allows to use a Trait containing async methods as <code>dyn</code> (e.g. use <code>dyn RoutingPolicy</code>, as we&rsquo;ll be doing below) instead of having to resort on generics to embed an async Trait inside another. The explanation is a bit complex (and I don&rsquo;t understand it completely 😅), so refer to the crate documentation for more infos.</p>
<p>We can now use the policy trait inside our program (I won&rsquo;t bother you with all the code, just the fundamental bits):</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice the type alias <code>SafeRoutingPolicy</code>, which has also the <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> trait. Why do we need them? The policy is stored in the shared app state, which may be accessed by multiple threads (actix can run the handler method on different threads).</p>
<p>The <code>actix_web::web::Data</code> struct is a wrapper around an <code>Arc</code>, which allows to access the structure from multiple threads. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the fields (e.g. the policy) are thread safe! This is also recalled by the compiler, which gives us a nice error if we don&rsquo;t require the policy to be <code>Sync + Send</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Send</code> means a type can be moved/sent to another thread (e.g. when we run the server by spawning the actix http handler)</li>
<li><code>Sync</code>means that the type can be shared and use between threads (e.g. by calling the policy <code>next</code> method from different threads)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the reasons I like rust: the compiler enforces us to use safe abstractions (e.g. forcing my policy to be <code>Sync</code>, a.k.a. thread safe) and explains that clearly in the compilation output!</p>
<h3 id="single-server-policy">Single Server Policy</h3>
<p>To finish our preparatory refactoring, we need to implement a routing policy which allows to always return a single server (the same thing we were doing in Part 1).</p>

<p>But why is the <code>idx</code> parameter an <code>AtomicUsize</code>? As explained in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicUsize.html"  target="_blank" >documentation</a>, this type allows to safely share the underlying value between threads, as it can be updated atomically. In fact, we update the index with the <code>fetch_update</code> method, which allows to update the number and get the value in a single action, without risking data races and inconsistency when used by multiple threads.</p>
<p>The <code>Ordering:Relaxed</code>params indicate the ordering constraint to be enforced on the atomic operation. I tried to read the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html"  target="_blank" >book</a> but didn&rsquo;t understand it completely, so refer to that to learn more about this. For now, we&rsquo;re ok using <code>Relaxed</code> (we are updating a counter and nothing more).</p>
<p>Now we have a round robin policy and the test passes. We can also replace the <code>SingleServerPolicy</code> created earlier with our new one and remove that temporary struct used for the refactoring!</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This is the end of Part 2. We cleaned up the load balancer code from <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/load-balancer-rust-1/"  target="_blank" >Part 1</a>, and added a simple Round-Robin policy to balance the load among multiple upstream servers. The code for this part can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/marcobacis/477191a3b908c27fd334137cf4b5ee1d"  target="_blank" >here</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the <a href="https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-load-balancer"  target="_blank" >coding challenge</a> is not finished&hellip;.the final step will be to periodically health check the upstream servers, in order to not forward the requests to the unavailable ones.</p>
<p>See you next time for Part 3!</p>

<p>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>This will be the first of a short series of posts, in which I explain my poor attempt at creating a simple HTTP load balancer in Rust.</p>
<p>Why a load balancer, and why rust?</p>
<p>I came across this challenge on the <a href="https://codingchallenges.fyi/"  target="_blank" >Coding Challenges</a> newsletter. I had already completed the first challenges (implementing <code>wc</code> and <code>cut</code>), and I thought it was time for a more complex project.</p>
<p>A load balancer provides tons of challenge and can be approached at different levels. From a simple round-robin strategy, to weights, connection pools, asynchronous I/O and much more!</p>
<p>Why Rust? Well, I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with rust for the past year, mostly by solving advent of code problems. It&rsquo;s a high performance, low level language with a mixture of features (e.g. statically typed, not garbage collected, borrow checker, pattern matching and other functional stuff, and zero-cost abstractions) that make it a &ldquo;different&rdquo; language from the ones I usually use at work (C# and a bit of Typescript).</p>
<p>It also sits on a &ldquo;lower&rdquo; level from my usual projects (it&rsquo;s mostly used as a system programming language and in infrastructure), and I think it&rsquo;s cool to learn about the technology which keep my stuff running under the hood!</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a hyped language 😎, and why shouldn&rsquo;t I try it? Following trends shouldn&rsquo;t always be bad .</p>
<p>A side note: I developed part of the load balancer during the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/open-source-saturday-milano/"  target="_blank" >Open Source Saturday Milan</a> meetup, with the help of <a href="https://github.com/MarcoIeni"  target="_blank" >Marco Ieni</a>. Marco is a rust expert and author of many rust crates and projects (e.g. his <a href="https://github.com/MarcoIeni/release-plz"  target="_blank" >release-plz</a> crate, which is fantastic) and he was of great help during the day. Without him, I would have taken a lot more time to setup the project and learn about Arc, Mutex and other async and multithread stuff! Thanks Marco for the help.</p>
<h2 id="load-balancer-basics">Load Balancer basics</h2>
<p>A load balancer is an application which sits in front of a group of servers, and routes the connection/requests across the servers in the group. By routing the requests to multiple backends, it allows to maximise availability (when a server goes down, requests can be redirected to the other servers in the pool) and utilisation (trying to use all servers at their maximum while keeping the latency low).</p>
<p>A load balancer can operate on different levels of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model"  target="_blank" >OSI model</a> (e.g. level 7, the application level, or level 4, the transport layer) with their advantages, disadvantages and numerous nuances.</p>
<p>In my case, the challenge was to create a simple load balancer working at the application level, forwarding HTTP requests. In this first post, we&rsquo;ll see a basic application forwarding HTTP requests to a single server.</p>
<h2 id="project-setup-and-a-first-test">Project setup and a first test</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start the challenge by creating the basic project in rust and writing a simple test. At first I started by coding the simplest application possible without any tests, but Marco showed me how to setup a simple (unit? integration? I  don&rsquo;t know) test for it, so let&rsquo;s do it the proper way 😅.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: the snippets I post here won&rsquo;t compile most of the time, if you want the complete and updated code (with spoilers) see the <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/coding-challenges/tree/main/load_balancer"  target="_blank" >repository</a></em></p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s create the project with cargo:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cargo new lb
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A common practice is to create a lib inside the crate, in order to extract common behaviour and keep the binary clean. This is a first version of the <code>cargo.toml</code>file:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this first step, all we care is that the load balancer is able to forward the request to a single upstream server. We create a mock server (using the <code>wiremock</code>crate, thanks to Marco&rsquo;s advice) to check that the request gets forwarded to it, then instantiate the load balancer and send a simple GET to it.</p>
<p>In pure (A)TDD style, this test doesn&rsquo;t even compile at first. Let&rsquo;s create at least the struct and the method required.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-http-forwarder">Creating a HTTP forwarder</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s open a connection and listen to requests on the port we passed to the load balancer. For now, we&rsquo;ll return a 200 on every request. How can we do it? <a href="https://actix.rs/"  target="_blank" >Actix</a> is a powerful framework for creating web services with rust. It relies on some concepts like extractors and handlers (better explained in their <a href="https://actix.rs/docs/getting-started"  target="_blank" >documentation</a> than here) that allow to easily create http endpoints.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s setup a simple server to respond to every request:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the <code>run</code> method of our load balancer, we instantiate an Http server which receives any request and returns &ldquo;hello!&rdquo;. The <code>default_service</code> in actix is a catch-all method which receives any request not handled by other services. We use the <code>web::to</code> helper function to create a generic any-method handler (accepting any HTTP method such as GET, POST, PUT etc&hellip;).</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s add some behaviour to the handler. We want it to forward the request to the (only) server we configured in our test. To do so, a first way is to just get the request, copy it and send it to the server, using <code>reqwest</code>. As I already said at the beginning of the post, my goal now is to create a simple proxy, without caring much about performance or functionality.</p>
<p>But how can we use the upstream server url in our request handler? Actix allows to share data between handlers using a concept called <a href="https://actix.rs/docs/application/#shared-mutable-state"  target="_blank" >web::Data</a>. It&rsquo;s a struct encapsulating an <code>Arc</code> (a thread-safe reference counting pointer) in which we can put data that must be shared (immutably or mutably) among handlers and requests.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s define the data we want to share (the servers urls) and add it to the application.</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post.</p>
<p>Today, I want to share a small glimpse of my experience at the 2024 Polenta &amp; Deploy event!</p>
<p>Polenta&amp;Deploy is an event taking place nestled beneath the mountains at Pinzolo. Over the course of three days, developers (and others) come together to enjoy the fresh air and discuss about tech (and not only that&hellip;) in an open space setup.</p>
<p><em>(Disclaimer: I didn&rsquo;t attend the previous editions, so please correct me if I&rsquo;m mistaken)</em></p>
<p>It all started after COVID restriction were lifted in 2021, and the <del>old</del> young trio of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aacerbis/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Acerbis</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocolla/"  target="_blank" >Alessandro Colla</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinandosantacroce/"  target="_blank" >Ferdinando Santacroce</a> gathered and pondered &ldquo;We want to meet people again, we&rsquo;re tired of online events!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From a telegram chat and a shared google doc, the three were able to organise an unconference, and we are now at the third edition.</p>
<p>Below you can find my &ldquo;journal&rdquo; of the event. Enjoy! (I know I&rsquo;m the only one reading through the entire post, but that&rsquo;s ok 😎).</p>
<h2 id="my-experience-at-polentadeploy">My Experience at Polenta&amp;Deploy</h2>
<h3 id="first-day-trip-and-nightly-snowshoe-hike">First Day: Trip and Nightly Snowshoe hike</h3>
<p>The first day started way before arriving at the hotel. I left Bergamo for the mountains with a guest: <a href="https://jagasantagostino.com/"  target="_blank" >Jaga</a>! During the trip we talked about his newfound love for home automation (I discovered a great millimiter-wave sensor that can track inside the house, and much more), home servers and his life in Sardinia.</p>
<p>After arriving at the nice small village of Pinzolo, it was time for the first activity of the Polenta&amp;Deploy: lunch! To inaugurate the event, I ate a nice Polenta with pork shank.</p>
<p>

<p>With a full stomach, it was now time for the first <strong>real</strong> activity: along with other fearless souls, we did a snowshoe hike in the Madonna di Campiglio park. It&rsquo;s been been 15 years since the last time I put snowshoes on, and it was not so easy! I did struggle a bit, but in the end we arrived at the hut (well, more like a 5-star restaurant&hellip;we&rsquo;re  in Trentino after all). Although we didn&rsquo;t hit our planned destination (we were 1 km short, and 200m below), we were still pretty satisfied. The hike was fantastic. I&rsquo;d never been on a snowy mountain at dusk before! The atmosphere was unreal, and seeing the sunset over the snow was pure magic.</p>

<h3 id="second-day-unconference-and-a-lot-of-food">Second Day: Unconference (and a lot of food)</h3>
<p>After a long night of sleep (about 5 hours), it was time for the main dish of the Polenta&amp;Deploy: the <strong>Unconference</strong>!</p>
<p>We all gathered in the hotel hall and kicked off the <em>marketplace</em>. Like in every open space I attend, I stayed back and didn&rsquo;t proposed anything, observing the others discuss where to put their session. I know I&rsquo;m not getting the most out of the event by not proposing a discussion, session or even just sharing a question I have. I&rsquo;m still looking for compelling or &ldquo;unique&rdquo; enough not already covered by the other sessions!</p>
<p>I already explained what is an open space <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/socrates-2023/"  target="_blank" >here</a>: the core idea is to let the participants choose what, when and where to talk, by creating a neverending &ldquo;coffee-break&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a (brief) list of the sessions I attended (some for full, others briefly):</p>
<p><strong>CI: From Stars to Stables</strong> -  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-fracassi/"  target="_blank" >Marco Fracassi</a></p>
<p>In his session, Marco shared his journey with Continuous Integration. It all began during his time at 7Pixel, where they had a single (physical) &ldquo;build machine&rdquo; shared among colleagues. Despite this (&ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; by today standards) setup, they were able to develop effectively with trunk-based development and CI.</p>
<p>However, in In his current company, the CI process is flawed. Developers work in isolation on their branches, which are then reviewed (and approved by at least 2 colleagues), merged into the dev branch and checked by QA. The issue arises after the QA phase: if the feature passes the QA review, it&rsquo;s merged into main - not starting from dev, but from the original feature branch! This destroys the concept of continuous integration, as the dev and main branches are never integrated!</p>
<p>We discussed what might have brought to this situation and how could Marco solve it. The idea is that developing in this way absolves developers of responsibility (&ldquo;QA approved this, so it must be fine&rdquo;), yet it doesn&rsquo;t actually improve code quality  or system reliability. In fact, this process risks breaking main, as integration occurs after the checks.</p>
<p>The group discussed some strategies (e.g. abolishing the dev branch, introducing feature flags and so on), but we all came to a conclusion: this situation needs a &ldquo;social&rdquo; solution, not only a technical one. Solving the problem requires to break the status quo inside the company, which is difficult when everything is going fine from the economical perspective (even if the code quality suffers).</p>
<p><strong>Ugly Code and Refactor</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli/"  target="_blank" >Gianni Bombelli</a></p>
<p>Gianni showed us a snippet of production code from one of his past projects, and then asked how we would refactor it. The code was a tangled mess of if-else, but at least it was tested!</p>
<p>The crowd discussed on which steps to take to make the code more readable (e.g. extracting methods, creating interfaces, adding smaller methods, embedding magic numbers into constants etc&hellip;). Gianni was able to refactor it using polymorphism (a somewhat-strategy-pattern) and he showed us how they did it at the time.</p>
<p>It was a valuable session on pragmatism (not every refactoring and optimisation is mandatory) and how to work on production code effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Specops</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocolla/"  target="_blank" >Alessandro Colla</a></p>
<p>Every job advert seems to insist that developers to &ldquo;must be able to work under stress&rdquo;. We all recognise it as a red flag, but it&rsquo;s something we cannot avoid no matter how hard we try. Given this, how can we train people to handle and manage stress effectively?</p>
<p>Alessandro drew inspiration from his martial arts and combat training and started a discussion with us. We exchanged a lot of quotes, links and ideas regarding team building and humility to stress management and being a great team player in general!</p>
<p>Another nice perk of being at an unconference&hellip;the discussion was done under the sun on the hotel terrace! Some of us were on reclining chairs.. as for me, I relaxed on a beanbag chair the entire time (talk about managing stress!).</p>
<p><strong>Recursive Thought</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanueledb/"  target="_blank" >Emanuele Delbono</a></p>
<p>Emanuele held a live coding session on Elixir, showing the exercises he used while reading The Little Schemer book (his solutions can be found <a href="https://github.com/emadb/the_little_alchemist"  target="_blank" >here</a>).</p>
<p>All the exercises he showed were about recursion. I understood some of them, but the latest were more difficult than expected! His explanation on tail recursion was clear, and I finally understood what it meant.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes Showdown</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludusrusso/"  target="_blank" >Ludovico Russo</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreafrancia/"  target="_blank" >Andrea Francia</a>**</p>
<p>In this session, Andrea ranted about Kubernetes, explaining why he think it&rsquo;s too complex to be used in most projects. On the other hand, Ludovico showed his <a href="https://www.ludusrusso.dev/blog/2022/09/kubernello"  target="_blank" >kubernello</a>, a small VM instance with kubernetes that he uses for small production projects. His setup was quite interesting, with automatic certificates and dns management, gitops and all at low cost! He was so inspiring I might actually create a small k8s cluster on Raspberry Pis (yes, it might be trivial and not interesting, but I don&rsquo;t care).</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphism in different languages</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeloceccato/"  target="_blank" >Angelo Ceccato</a>**</p>
<p>Angelo started his discussion by showing a graph with all the main programming languages and going back to the roots. Together with the participants, he tried to distill what constitutes Object-Oriented Programming (we had a board full of post-it with definitions). He then tried to link together concepts from all these languages and define the main topic of his discussion: Polymorphism.</p>
<p>I must admit that I didn&rsquo;t follow the discussion too much, but it provided a lot of perspectives on concepts we don&rsquo;t usually think too much about in OOP. It was a trip in the history of programming languages concepts and styles.</p>
<p><strong>There is no silver bullet</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morialberto/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Mori</a></p>
<p>Alberto asked for help/feedback on a talk he proposed to a conference. The title of his talk was &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no siver bullet&rdquo; (a clear reference to Fred Brooks&rsquo; paper, even if he didn&rsquo;t know it 😂) and the idea was to discuss complexity and how some techniques, even if not perfect, can help reduce it.</p>
<p>What started as a feedback session became a discussion on managing the complexity of human and business behaviour. We talked about essential and accidental complexity, different &ldquo;layers&rdquo; of complexity, on how a company can learn to tackle the complexity and how to communicate it to the customer and the developers without being overwhelmed by the task.</p>
<h3 id="third-day-unconference-and-goodbye">Third Day: Unconference and Goodbye</h3>
<p>The last day started with a good breakfast (the perks of good conferences). While a small group went out for a <em>short</em> hike (more on that later), we picked up where we left off the day before and continued the unconference.</p>
<p>Here are the sessions I attended (just three, we finished by midday):</p>
<p><strong>Intro to Qwik</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludusrusso/"  target="_blank" >Ludovico Russo</a></p>
<p>A nice quirk of unconferences is the chance to <del>force</del> <em>ask</em> other people to give sessions. This was the case, when Gerson asked Ludovico to show him how <a href="https://qwik.dev/"  target="_blank" >Qwik</a> works!</p>
<p>Ludovico obliged to the request and showed us a small example of a quik application, explaining its Server-Side-Rendering approach (resumability). I didn&rsquo;t know much about SSR, but I will try to learn it more after getting a glimpse of what it can do!</p>
<p><strong>1-on-1 for dummies</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maddalena-germinario/"  target="_blank" >Maddalena Germinario</a></p>
<p>Maddalena had her first-ever round of 1-to-1 sessions with her team after becoming tech lead&hellip; and she asked for our feedback on how to improve! The group had a discussion on how to have a great 1-to-1s, from the perspective of both the team lead and the members.</p>
<p>We talked about trust, career development, feedback, psychology, tools and methods, and it was a great source of information about 1-to-1s and how to treat people at work in general (and how to manage 1-to-1 sessions as a manager without getting crazy afterwards).</p>
<p><strong>Intro to Hono and Deploy to prod on Kubernello</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludusrusso/"  target="_blank" >Ludovico Russo</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicogandellini/"  target="_blank" >Federico Gandellini</a></p>
<p>The final session of Polenta &amp; Deploy witnessed a historic moment as Ludovico and Federico executed the first ever production deployment during a Polenta&amp;Deploy event!</p>
<p>Federico wanted to create a small application using <a href="https://hono.dev/"  target="_blank" >Hono</a>, a framework for developing backend APIs and websites in nodejs. Together with Ludovico, they developed a small application and then deployed it on Ludovico&rsquo;s kubernello.</p>
<p>Watching them develop and deploy a small page in 30 minutes was impressive, and it left me inspired to create my own small kubernello setup!
I won&rsquo;t share the final url (just in case someone decides to DDoS kubernello 😅), but trust me, it was a great session.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>After the unconference ended, we went to a restaurant in the mountains near Pinzolo and waited for the others.</p>
<p>I made a good choice staying at the hotel for the unconference&hellip; the <em>small</em> hike the other group started in the morning turned out to be a 3/4 hour-long adventure in the snow (sans snowshoes this time) and the group came back late, tired, and wet!</p>
<p>We ate the last polenta, and as the rain started to fall and replace the snow around us, it reminded us it was time to go home.</p>
<p>This Polenta &amp; Deploy was great. I already had my unconference initiation at <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/socrates-2023/"  target="_blank" >SoCraTes</a>, and I firmly believe this format is way better than any standard conference.</p>
<p>An unconference offers a safe, intimate space where everyone can share their opinions, provide feedback, and support others. Being surrounded by the Trentino mountains was the cherry on top for me. While I&rsquo;m not particularly happy to hike on them (too hard!), I do love being in the mountains and spending time with like-minded people, so this was an incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and see you next time!</p>

        <img src="https://marcobacis.com/blog/show-your-work-book/cover_hu_c489c43f5925e5d9.jpg" title="%!s(<nil>)" alt="%!s(<nil>)"/>
          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>This blog is becoming more and more a journal and a collection of book summaries 😅 I promise I’ll write more about technical stuff soon.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to give a small summary and comment of a book I recently read: “Show Your Work!” by <a href="https://austinkleon.com/"  target="_blank" >Austin Kleon</a> . Austin is a “writes who draws”, and his books on creativity are all formatted in crazy ways (and with a really nice finish)!</p>
<p>In “Show Your Work” Austin shares some ways in which everyone can share his creative work (even if he doesn’t think of it as creative, as us programmers!). Let’s get into it!</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I put some of my comments and ideas in this post, so it’s not a proper “summary”, but just some notes with my thoughts attached.</em></p>
<h2 id="a-new-way-of-operating">A New Way of Operating</h2>
<p>Talking about <em>self-promotion</em> is always difficult. Comedian Steve Martin dodges the question by saying “Be so good they can’t ignore you” (there&rsquo;s also a book from Cal Newport <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124"  target="_blank" >with the same title</a>). Being good is an obvious way to be found, but is’t not enough. In order to be found, you must be <em>findable.</em></p>
<p>That’s the premise of the book. Many creative people have built <em>sharing</em> in their routine, and the this is a sort of manual to learn how to to share small bits of your work, consistently.</p>
<p>Austin shares 10 pieces of advice on how to share creative work and get found. Here I wrote a  summary (I actually re-read the entire book while writing this notes!) of the 10 main chapters of the book.</p>
<h3 id="1-you-dont-have-to-be-a-genius">1. You don’t have to be a genius</h3>
<p>The first myth that Austin debunks is that of the <em>lone, perfect genius</em> working on his piece of art. The idea of creative work as a lone, antisocial activity is far from the truth! Instead, many works and projects are created by groups of people sharing their interests, something that the author refers as “<em>scenius</em>”. The internet is a perfect example of a scenius, in which everyone can share what they are doing and the results of their work without fear.</p>
<p>The other myth we must debunk is that we need to be <em>expert</em> to share our work. It’s the complete opposite! Being an <em>amateur</em> has many advantages: amateurs are continuous learners, can learn in public and care less about making mistakes and being ridiculous. In addition, the modern world is making everyone an amateur, so we have no excuses.</p>
<p>A final advice that Austin gives in this chapter is that to <em>find your voice</em>, you must use it! So, forget impostor syndrome and just start sharing what you are learning. I must admit, I’m not following this point right now, but I think we should all try to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public"  target="_blank" >learn in public</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-think-process-not-product">2. Think process, not product</h3>
<p>The first chapter was more for inspiration, to let us feel that we can indeed share our work even if we are not expert or geniuses. With the second chapter, we get into the practicals of what to share.</p>
<p>In particular, Austin argues that it’s important to share not only the final <em>product</em> (piece of art, book, software etc..), but also the entire <em>process</em> followed to create the product!</p>
<p>As humans, we are curious and want to know what other human beings are doing, and how they are doing it. Sharing the creative process to create something is a perfect way to  create a bond with the audience and make others part of the process itself.</p>
<p>Think about all the short videos, social posts, pictures that content creators share everyday!</p>
<p>The practical advice of the chapter is then to start collecting small pieces of evidence, the residue of our process, and shape it in some piece of media to share with others.</p>
<p>Some ideas to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>A work log/journal showing the progress, thoughts and ideas explored while working</li>
<li>Pictures/videos/blog posts showing the work in progress and sketches</li>
<li>Day-to-day activities (no matter how boring they may seem, someone will find them interesting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting the process is not only a way to share the work, but also to think about it more critically, to get a sense of progress and to track how things are going.</p>
<h3 id="3-share-something-small-every-day">3. Share something small every day</h3>
<p>The third advice Austin gives us is to “share something small every day”. Small means updates on an ongoing project, inspirations, notes, sketches and whatever comes out of your work process.</p>
<p>Focusing on every single day helps in creating a habit (see <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/atomic-habits-book/"  target="_blank" >Atomic Habits</a>) and allows to create a bond with other people. Over the years, all of this shared collection will become a piece of work itself.</p>
<p>To share something every day, we can use <strong>both</strong> social media and a personal website. Social media is helpful in creating daily updates and sharing to a larger audience, while a website is our own personal space in which to put all our ideas, progresses and results.</p>
<p>Remember: a website is not a self-promotion machine, but rather a <em>self-invention</em> machine! It represents a big notebook in which to put our thoughts. For example, even if I’m not creating something every day, I like to write on this blog to have clearer ideas and to better recall what I learn and experience.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember the first advice, “you don’t have to be a genius”. Everyone can share something small, even if he thinks that it’s crap (I keep thinking like this myself, and still here you are reading my posts 😅).</p>
<p>The other excuse is that we don’t have time to do this, but time can always be found during the day: commuting, waiting in line, lunch break or in the evening (skipping one TV episode is not so bad sometimes). Even if I’m not writing this blog or programming in every minute of my life, I still try to find some moments to write or save something interesting I found. Just remember (and I usually forget) that this sharing time shouldn’t interfere with the actual time to do the <strong>work</strong> we are sharing.</p>
<p>Finally, even if all the book is about sharing and showing everything related to our work (creative or not), it’s important to not <em>overshare</em>. Every time you want to share something, ask “<strong>so what?</strong>”. Share imperfect and unfinished work, share notes and how you get inspired, but don’t share <em>absolutely everything</em>.</p>
<h3 id="4-open-up-your-cabinet-of-curiosities">4. Open up your cabinet of curiosities</h3>
<p>The fouth advice in how to share our work is to “open up our cabinet of curiosities”. A cabinet of curiosities was a room filled with exotic and strange pieces (biological or human-made) which went viral in the 16th-17th century, a precursor to modern museums.</p>
<p>We all have a similar place in which we put everything: books we read, movies we watch, art pieces which inspires us, website we visit and so on. We must open our collection and share it with others: it helps in showing our process (creating and collecting are not so different after all) and finding people with the same taste as us.</p>
<p>Another advice is to not feel guilty of the “garbage” we collect! Be open and honest and don’t let other people criticise things you genuinely enjoy. On the other hand, don’t try be “hip” or “cool” by criticising other people collections, but use this as an occasion to connect with people.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to give credit to the authors of the stuff you collect and share! Attribution acts like the label on a museum piece, and allows others to reach the same sources you found and took inspiration from. The easiest way to give credit on the internet is to share a link to the author’s website, or mentioning them on a post (this also helps with the whole “connection” idea).</p>
<p>How does this advice translate to my work as a developer? Well, one of the outcomes of this blog is exactly to share stuff which inspires me. Every book, conference or other thing I summarise and share on this site is a something I found interesting, inspiring or useful to my work, and that’s why it’s here 😜.</p>
<h3 id="5-tell-good-stories">5. Tell Good Stories</h3>
<p>The fifth advice Austin gives us is to “tell good stories”. We must create a compelling story behind our work, a narration which allows to increase its value.</p>
<p>But shouldn’t our work <em>speak by itself</em>? Unfortunately, it’s not like this in the real world. Don’t forget that we create for other people to consume or admire, and humans look for <em>connection</em>.</p>
<p>The value of something is deeply affected by the <em>story</em> we tell about it. A story helps other people in connecting with our work, be it by sharing the “behind the scenes”, showing the frustrations, the failures and also the great moments behind a piece.</p>
<p>Of course, good storytelling is a difficult skill to acquire. A good story should follow a proven structure: think about fairy tales or most fiction and non-fiction books. The book highlights some structures to take inspiration from (<a href="https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/story-structure/dan-harmon-story-circle"  target="_blank" >Dan Harmon’s story circle</a>, <a href="https://bigthink.com/high-culture/vonnegut-shapes/"  target="_blank" >Kurt Vonnegut Graphs</a>, <a href="https://writers.com/freytags-pyramid"  target="_blank" >Gustav Freytag’s Pyramid</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, everyone of us is in the middle of a story, so we must try to find “sub-stories” to tell: every single thing we share is a <em>pitch</em>, a story with its ending chopped off. A pitch has a starting point (the past), the current story (present) and an open-ended ending, which puts the listener in the hero who decides how it’s going to end.</p>
<p>A good example of storytelling is when someone asks “So, what do you do?”. I must admit that the answer is easy for people with known professions (like me 😛). Even then, we need to practice our personal story. The important thing is to keep it real (stick to the facts and do not invent!) and to keep in mind the current audience. Telling a story about oneself shouldn’t be an opportunity to brag about yourself, but to connect to someone else in an honest way.</p>
<h3 id="6-teach-what-you-know">6. Teach what you know</h3>
<p>So, now we know we don’t need to be genius, are sharing something small about our process every day, opened up our “collection” and crafted good stories about our work.</p>
<p>What comes after that?</p>
<p>Teaching!</p>
<p>Our work is not secret. Actually, we want to show it to others. Many people think that they should keep their trade secrets, well, secret. But teaching allows to connect more with the audience. By learning something about your work, they will appreciate it more and get more interested.</p>
<p>Moreover, teaching helps in learning better. I won’t cite the entire quote from Edgar Dale, just this part: “we remember 95% of what we teach others”. So, as soon as you learn something, turn around and teach it to others!</p>
<h3 id="7-dont-turn-into-human-spam">7. Don’t turn into human spam</h3>
<p>Up to this point, the book highlighted some ways to share work. In this chapter it warns against becoming “human spam” instead.</p>
<p>What is a “human spam”? It’s a person who shares its work and make himself known, but without living in the community before. Everything they say it’s about their work, while they do not participate in others work.</p>
<p>For example, an artist showing off his skills without watching other artists, a writer who wants to get published without reading the publications himself, or (in my case) a programmer talking about programming without getting involved in programming communities and projects first.</p>
<p>Instead of caring about the number of followers, we should care about the <em>quality</em>, of both the people we connect to and, first, of our work. How can we pretend to be interesting if the work itself isn’t.</p>
<p>In this regards I must admit that sometimes I feel more like the bad examples of this chapter: I like to share this blog and to know people, but I don’t work enough on my <em>hard</em> skills (programming) and don’t participate enough in programming communities (e.g. to share what I know or help others). This chapter is then a wake up call to do so!</p>
<p>A final advice the chapter gives identify and meet up with people with the same interests (Austin gives an example of the “Knuckleballers” group of baseball pitchers). Meetups are a great way to meet people you already know or follow, or that have your same interests, to share and talk about “big ideas” in your space. It’s a more intimate form of networking. He also says to just ask people</p>
<h3 id="8-learn-to-take-a-punch">8. Learn to take a punch</h3>
<p>When you share your work in public, you have to be ready for (harsh) criticism. Austin shares some techniques to deal with that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relax and breathe</strong>: criticism is not the end of the world, and most of the time it’s our brain which imagines the worst outcomes. Just accept whatever comes, you cannot control it</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen your neck</strong>: the way to learn how to take a punch is to take a lot. So just publish a lot, and get out your comfort zone many times to get comfortable with critics</li>
<li><strong>Roll with the punches</strong>: keep moving despite the comments, it might become fun to get your work hated by some people!</li>
<li><strong>Protect your vulnerable areas</strong>: if some work is too sensitive, just keep it hidden… but do not hide everything from the world!</li>
<li><strong>Keep your balance</strong>: keep what you do (your work) and who you are (yourself) separated</li>
<li><strong>Don’t feed the trolls</strong>: filter out people who are not interested in you or your work, they just want to roll in the mud with your self-doubt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-sell-out">9. Sell out</h3>
<p>We’re almost at then end of the sharing advice. After sharing all the behind-the-scenes, teaching, staying humble and taking the punch, it’s time to <strong>sell</strong> our work.</p>
<p>This chapter doesn’t resonate much with me (I’m already paid to do what I do, which is software), but it should be a wake up call to artists to stop thinking that being a “sellout” is bad. After all, most of the art in history was done by commission.</p>
<p>At some point, the creative must take the leap from sharing freely their work to selling it. The first way to do so is to “ask for donations”. A simple “buy me a coffee” button or a patreon account can do miracles. Another way is to ask for funding for your next work, with websites like indiegogo or kickstarter. A note on this method: when a person becomes a patreon or donates something, he will feel entitled to have a say on your work: you can still chose the “old-fashioned” model of selling stuff if you don’t want this kind of relation.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method (donations, crowdfunding, standard selling) a good advice is to keep a mailing list, on platforms such as mailchimp or substack. Some people directly make money through these platform, but the real value lies in the mail addresses of the people subscribed: they are the most loyal fans, and every mail will go directly in their inbox (and attention). Whenever you are ready to sell or ask something, they’ll be the first you want to contact.</p>
<p>“Selling out” isn’t a bad thing. Whenever a new opportunity comes around, check if the new work is something you want to do, and then do it, even if some people will treat you like a sellout… it’s their opinion, not yours.</p>
<p>Finally, when (if) you become successful enough, remember to share back with the one who helped you and your fans, but to not become so overwhelmed that you can’t do your work… learn to say “no” a lot.</p>
<h3 id="10-stick-around">10. Stick around</h3>
<p>In the last chapter, Austin gives some advice on how to continue with you career (creative or not).</p>
<p>The first advice is to not <strong>quit the show</strong>. Working and creating are difficult, and sometimes we might be tempted to just stop. But most of the reward happens when you stick long enough. This is pretty simple to tell, but difficult to do when it’s needed (e.g. I should not quit learning continuously new programming methods or this blog!).</p>
<p>The second advice is to keep the momentum, or as Austin calls it, do “chain-smoking”. Whenever you finish and publish a piece, don’t stop there getting feedback and thinking. Just start a new thing! I must admit to be a victim of this sin. When I finish writing a post for the blog I wait before starting a new one. This leads to me losing momentum, and taking a long time to start again…</p>
<p>Even if the first advice of the chapter is to not quite, at some point in might be useful to <strong>go away</strong> from your work. This can take the form of a long sabbatical, or a small act to do every day (like commuting, exercising or going into the nature). The important thing is to take a break.</p>
<p>Finally, after mastering your current knowledge, it’s time to begin again (as a student) and find something new to learn. Of course this doesn’t mean losing all your previous work (you are not quitting your show, remember?), but working on top of it. As all the previous advice says, begin to learn new stuff, document everything and share it with the world.</p>
<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it!</h2>
<p>I found this book quite useful and inspiring.</p>
<p>Austin showed that showing off your work a little bit evey day is not impossibile, and is not exclusive of prodogies and geniuses.</p>
<p>In fact, I think this book can be an inspiration for everyone to just start sharing something about their work.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s not easy to start! I find it difficult to gather the courage to share something about my work (in fact, until now this blog has been more of a “journal” than a real portfolio for my skills), but in the future I hope this will change for the better.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, and see you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I want to write a short post about my recent adventure with open source software, and in particular the experience at my very first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/open-source-saturday-milano/"  target="_blank" >Open Source Saturday Milan</a>!</p>
<p>Open Source Saturday is an event held once a month, organised by <a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana"  target="_blank" >Gabriele</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fusillicode"  target="_blank" >Gianluca</a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielemegna"  target="_blank" >Daniele</a>. The format is simple: some nerds gather for the entire day in a specific place, and the goal is to contribute to open source!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the day, everyone presents himself and gives a short pitch of what he wants to do for the day. The possibilities are endless:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask for help on a personal project</li>
<li>propose a new project to develop alone or with others</li>
<li>look for projects in a specific technology/framework/paradigm</li>
<li>gather along and find out what to do and get inspired (my case)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I have never contributed to an open source project before. Yes, I have some repos online, but they are just exercises or university projects. Also, this was my first time participating in this kind of event, so I was both excited and worried at the same time.</p>
<p>I arrived at the location with the idea of learning Rust. In fact, in the last two weeks I was reading the online rust <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/"  target="_blank" >book</a> (again) to get a better idea about ownership and lifetimes. So, my pitch was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Marco and I know nothing of rust, so I&rsquo;m looking for a rust project to contribute to!</p></blockquote>
<p>As always, things turn out differently form what we expect. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even see a single line of rust!</p>
<p>As I listened to the others presenting their projects, one project in particular caught my attention: <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri"  target="_blank" >Giacomo</a> is a main contributor to a functional programming language called <a href="https://gleam.run/"  target="_blank" >gleam</a>, which had a compiler written in Rust.</p>
<p>This was my chance! I approached giacomo after the &ldquo;standup&rdquo; and started learning about Gleam and its environment. First I followed the gleam <a href="https://tour.gleam.run/"  target="_blank" >tour</a> to get a glimpse of what the language was all about.</p>
<p>

</figure></p>
<p>Gleam is a functional programming language focused on type safety, expressiveness and reliability. It&rsquo;s not a pure functional language like haskell in that it allows to write sequential instruction&hellip;but the rest is all functional and immutable 👍.</p>
<p>Gleam can be transpiled for two runtimes: the BEAM virtual machine of erlang, and javascript (both node and browser versions). This might be an unusual choice, but I think it can help the language spread more. After all, erlang is a <strong>very</strong> reliable language for large scale applications, and javascript is the ubiquitous language for the web. Targeting both worlds allows to cover the full stack, and using a FP language with a strong type system allows to get the best of both worlds (reliability and safeness, even when using a brittle language like javascript 🔥).</p>
<p>Instead of directly starting with the compiler (after all, a compiler is a dangerous beast, and I don&rsquo;t know enough about both rust and compilers to do something useful in a single day 🥲), Giacomo showed me his pretty printing library written in gleam, called <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/glam"  target="_blank" >glam</a>.  He then started giving a primer on how pretty printing works. I never thought about it, but printing and formatting text is not an easy task, and Giacomo&rsquo;s library does a great job in defining custom formatting specs.</p>
<p>We tried defining a pretty-printing format for json together as an exercise. It wasn&rsquo;t so trivial after all, and helped me get an idea of how the library worked.</p>
<p>After all this preparation (we already had lunch, and the end of the day was approaching fast), it was time for my first PR! I had to add a small functionality, the possibility to add &ldquo;zero width strings&rdquo; to the formatting specification. A zero width string is a string which doesn&rsquo;t impact the total line length of the formatted document. This length is used by the formatting algorithm to decide when to break a piece of output in multiple lines, so it&rsquo;s pretty important. An example of zero width strings are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code"  target="_blank" >ANSI escape codes</a>, used in the console to do crazy stuff (change colorus, set the cursor position and so on). These characters do not impact the line width usually, so they are the perfect candidate for this feature.</p>
<p>In the end, the functionality itself was a 1-line method. I added an example and a couple of tests for the method and sent my first PR! Fortunately for me I had Giacomo side-by-side, so I didn&rsquo;t experience the usual async review of open source projects. Even if he later did some modifications to my PR (changing the way my test worked and other stuff) I had <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/glam/pull/12"  target="_blank" >my first PR ever</a> merged!</p>
<p>

<figcaption class="caption">The right kind of dopamine hit</figcaption>

</figure></p>
<p>After merging my PR, we worked together on another issue he had for his project: creating a <code>debug</code> method to pretty-print a document specification itself. I basically watched him do all the work, but it was interesting to see some gleam features (such as pipelines, string concatenation and so on) and in the end we had a nice result.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Time for some considerations.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun! This was my first Open Source Saturday, and I managed to do way more than I expected. I thought I wasn&rsquo;t prepared, that I needed a brilliant idea to bring, that I&rsquo;d make a fool of myself&hellip; but none of this was true! The important thing is to participate with an open mind and simply enjoy it.</p>
<p>Giacomo was a perfect mentor. He showed me the basics of gleam, brought me a project and even an issue on which to work, and in the end helped me with the review and PR process. I was basically hand-held through the process, and I think it&rsquo;s the perfect way to start contributing without all the fear and the bias the open source world has (for some of us at least)!</p>
<p>Finally, this event reminded me that there is a lot to learn, and that outside of the main languages and frameworks there&rsquo;s an entire world of alternative paradigms and technologies. I didn&rsquo;t even know gleam existed until today, or that pretty-printing algorithms were a thing 😅.</p>
<p>In the end&hellip;.did I write this entire self-celebrating post for a 1-line method? Yes, and I&rsquo;m very proud of it!</p>
<p>See you next time! 😜</p>

          <p>Hi  👋 and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I want to share with you a summary on the last meetup I attended, organized by the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/xpugmi/"  target="_blank" >Milan eXtreme Programming Group</a>.</p>
<p>This time , <a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana"  target="_blank" >Gabriele Lana</a> gave his advice on the pros and cons of microservices, and the problems (and solutions) that he found in his experience.</p>
<p>Gabriele is a consultant with over 20 years of experience, founder of the Milan XPUG and a nerd at heart (he still likes to play with cabinets and has contributed to a <a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana/emacs-nes"  target="_blank" >NES simulator in emacs</a>, among other stuff!!).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
<h2 id="microservices-architecture-definition">Microservices Architecture Definition</h2>
<p>Gabriele started with a premise: Microservices are currently (and have been for  years) still in their &ldquo;hype&rdquo; phase. Hype is a double-edged sword: it means that it&rsquo;s easier to get buy-in for using them, but (as all engineers know) there&rsquo;s the risk to <em>fit the problem to the solution</em>, instead of finding the right solution for the job.
In fact, microservices are most of the times used without proper reasons, and that&rsquo;s the main source of issues.</p>
<p>Then, he gave a simple definition of microservices (which can be used to describe anything really, as he admitted): &ldquo;<em>Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But how big should a microservices be in reality? Given the &ldquo;micro&rdquo; prefix, we might think that their size matters. Some schools of thought say they should be as big as a small team can implement in a month, others will talk in terms of number of lines (hundreds? thousands?). The advent of serverless computing has made thei size even more relevant.</p>
<p>Gabriele gave the usual answer: <em>it depends</em>!</p>
<p>But what does it depends from? For Gabriele, the size of a microservice should be intended as the size perceived from outside, such as the API surface.
A microservice might have millions of lines (e.g. doing video encoding and processing) but still be &ldquo;micro&rdquo; because it does just one thing!! On the other hand, a small CRUD service might have a large surface area and handle a lot of entities, and thus be too complex to make a single microservice. In the end, the size depends on the domain of the system we are going to develop for.</p>

</figure></p>
<p>After giving a mandatory definition of microservices and their &ldquo;micro&rdquo;-ness, Gabriele gave an overview of the pros and cons of employing a microservices architecture in our systems.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the pros of microservice architectures:</p>
<p><strong>Diversity</strong></p>
<p>With microservices, the company can diversify their technology: each microservice can in fact be implemented with the most suitable language or framework for the problem.
In addition to this, diversity allows to integrate new technologies in a system without rewriting everything from scratch! It also allows to be more appealing to engineers who want to learn new languages, and to follow the trends (still being cautious of using too much new technology - stick to the old, good stuff!).
One con of diversity is that it can bring more complexity (see below) and requires more standards and a better culture.</p>
<p><strong>Resiliency</strong></p>
<p>If you partition well the responsibilities inside the system, splitting it in multiple microservices helps increase its availability.
Even when some services are down, the others stays up, and that increases the resiliency of the application as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>By splitting an architecture in services, each functionality can scale differently from the others. For example, a central feature of the system might need more resources to run and be used by many users, while other parts of the system might need less resources.
This scalability pro is even more useful when using serverless architectures, which in some cases can help cut costs considerably.</p>
<p><strong>Independence</strong></p>
<p>Independence here is related to the possibility to independently deploy different parts of the system at different times and frequency. By deploying services independently, we can keep the availability of the system high and allow developers to develop features without the fear of &ldquo;big bad deployments&rdquo; (the one you don&rsquo;t want to do on a friday).</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Conway&rsquo;s law states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following this law, using microservices helps in aligning the technical side of the system to the topology of the organization (e.g. assigning a microservice to each team separately).</p>
<p>However, microservices can also lead the opposite to happen, called <em>Inverse conway&rsquo;s law</em>: given an existing system, the organization is forced to organise in the same way as the system&rsquo;s components! This is usually difficult to perform, and leads to issues down the line.</p>
<p><strong>Composability</strong></p>
<p>Here Gabriele just said &ldquo;ah&hellip;classic&rdquo; 🥲 so I have nothing to write.</p>
<p>If I have to add two lines on the argument, I can cite something Gabriele said later, which is that microservices are just a deployment method, and all the rest is standard software architecture and design. So, composability is not a pro by itself, but it&rsquo;s a requirement for doing microservices 😜.</p>
<p><strong>Replaceability</strong></p>
<p>Finally, microservices are easily replaceable. I can implement a service, then experiment with it. The usual examples are canaries (used in deployments) and A/B tests. By being independent and resilient, microservices allows to experiment much more than a monolith, without impacting on the entire product at once.</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>After listing all the (somewhat) pros of microservices, Gabriele started explaining the cons. They are less than the pros, but of way higher magnitude, and can impact much more the business and the developers if encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Microservices introduce complexity on multiple levels. The main one is the communication.  Calling a method in a monolith is a straightforward thing to do: just call the method and, if no cosmic rays are involved, you will know the answer right away.</p>
<p>Distributed systems are a different thing altogether. When you send a message to another component, you cannot know if you will receive a response, and cannot know why (did the other component receive the message but didn&rsquo;t complete? did it complete the request but I wasn&rsquo;t able to receive the response? is the other component malicious?).</p>
<p>In addition to the inherent complexity of the network, splitting a system into multiple services introduces complexity in the communication patterns (I need other services to other data) which can be worsened if the system isn&rsquo;t partitioned properly.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>Microservices can make unit testing easy and fast (the service is small afterall). It&rsquo;s the integration testing which becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>How can we test microservices?</p>
<p>Some techniques (such as using mocks and contract testing to check the connection with other services) are useful, but they allow to test a part of the system. Testing the whole system becomes more difficult, and testing it while maintaining independence of development and deployment is even more complex.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Deploying a microservices architecture requires more automation on the infrastructure, and more so if the number of services increases. The business must have a strong DevOps culture to manage this kind of system effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
<p>Forget strong consistency and ACID properties! With microservices comes the burden of eventual consistency and asynchronous communication (at least to make the most out of it).</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>This is not a con per se, but a factor that must be considered. For simple application a microservices architecture might be too expensive, while it could bring the costs down for a complex system (more so if using serverless).</p>
<p><strong>(Plus) Debugging</strong></p>
<p>In the same way testing is more complex, debugging also becomes more difficult while dealing with microservices, especially if an issue is caused by multiple services. It&rsquo;s essential to setup observability (tracing and logging) as first thing when using microservices, and even with these tools tracking an error can be difficult.</p>
<h2 id="3-of-the-worst-problems">3 of the Worst Problems</h2>
<p>The first part of this summary covers just 30 minutes of the talk. What is the rest of the meetup about (one hour and half)?</p>
<p>In the main part of his talk, Gabriele highlighted the 3 worst issues affecting microservices architectures, their causes, symptoms, cure and prevention!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t take much notes on this part, so this summary will be shorter than the pros/cons. To learn more, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1quMproQ5Hk"  target="_blank" >video</a>.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">Wrong Responsibility, thanks to Stefano Martinelli again</figcaption>

</figure></p>
<p>The first (and worst) risk with microservices architecture is to partition the system wrong!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you design the system the wrong way, using microservices will only worsen the issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gabriele sees microservices only as a deploy model, in the sense that they aren&rsquo;t a solution to bad software design, but just a tool.</p>
<p>When the system is badly designed (with <strong>high coupling</strong> and <strong>low cohesion</strong>) making changes becomes exponentially more difficult. When a component needs some data which is not in the right spot, it needs to communicate with another service to get it. If this happens too many times, it means the component suffers of a pattern called <em>feature envy</em>. The envious component keeps asking for data (or actions) to the other component.</p>
<p>The issue is made worse by the network: when a component is envious in a monolith, all is solved with a method call. In a microservice architecture this involves the network instead, with all its related issues (latency, availability, byzantine faults and so on)!</p>
<p>In the 90s/2000s vendors tried to sell similar stuff, with CORBA and RMI. This didn&rsquo;t end well&hellip;instead, it&rsquo;s important to reduce the communication to a minimum and employ the Single Responsibility Principle, in the same way we employ it in a standard OOP monolith. As already said above, a bad system design will just get worse with microservices.</p>
<p>What can we do if we have a big ball of mud monolith and need to split it? The first thing is to refactor the monolith in order to fix the mess, and only then to split it in microservices! It&rsquo;s important to disentangle and uncouple all the components while it&rsquo;s still easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what if everything is strongly connected because of our domain?&rdquo; Gabriele provoked us with a questioner a customer may give. The solution is simple&hellip;.keep the monolith! Using microservices is not mandatory, and should be done only if there is the need (and the skill) to do it. Splitting a strongly coupled system wrong instead would only lead to pain.</p>
<h3 id="2-shared-database">2. Shared Database</h3>
<p>This is an issue I&rsquo;ve been guilty multiple times: using a shared database between microservices!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First rule of microservices: each microservice must have a separate database.</p></blockquote>
<p>If multiple services share the same db (access and schema altogether), then the database becomes the same as a central, global variable that everyone has access to. With a central database there is no independent deploy (how can I run migration and change the schema if others depend on it?) and making changes becomes difficult.</p>
<p>But what causes the presence of a shared database? Gabriele gave a few culprits:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the DB is used to configure/customise the system</li>
<li>Data Driven Design (when we first design the tables and then the rest)</li>
<li>Database Normalization (how we are tipically taught to design a DB schema&hellip;)</li>
<li>False need of strong consistency from the business side</li>
<li>Database containing business logic as the central part of the system (e.g. using triggers and stored procedures)</li>
</ul>
<p>How can we prevent this from happening?
The first thing to do it to not fear denormalization and to stop doing data-driven design. Instead, we should base our design on the behaviour and actions of the users (so DDD, BDD and so on) and learn that it&rsquo;s ok to split the data related to an entity among multiple databases!</p>
<p>Gabriele gave the example of the humble <strong>Order</strong> entity. An order can be represented differently by each distinct department inside the company. Each can add tens of fields into it&hellip; Sometimes the order might even be created before the user is logged or even if the goods are not available yet!</p>
<p>What should we do in this case? Create a single table with hundreds of (mostly unrelated) fields and used by all services? Nope!</p>
<p>Instead, we should have a shared id for the same entity, but store it in every microservice only with the data pertaining to that service, of which the service is responsible. It might be the Shipping Address for the logistics service, the credit card details for the Finance service, and the id and position of the goods for the warehouse service.</p>
<h3 id="3-distributed-monolith">3. Distributed Monolith</h3>
<p>The last issue Gabriele mentioned is the infamous &ldquo;Distributed Monolith&rdquo;. It happens when we use too much synchronous communication when building our microservices, coupling the system and making it harder to change and deploy independently.</p>
<p>Synchronous communication creates more coupling than asynchronous, because when sending a synchronous request, we wait for the response&hellip;. what could go wrong? As already seen with the other 2 issues, everything!!</p>
<p>The solution for this issue is to embrace asynchronous communication between services (not caring if the response arrives and when) and eventual consistency. Many system can work just fine with eventual consistency, even if we don&rsquo;t realise it.</p>
<p>Gabriele also mentioned some concepts of <em>distributed system design</em> that can help create a reliable distributed system, such as the use of circuit breakers. In the end, we must understand the distributed nature of microservice and not to go against it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Gabriele&rsquo;s talk was a long and detailed list of reasons why not to use microservices 😂.  I really liked his style of presentation (without filters and talking about real systems and issues).</p>
<p>I recently read the book &ldquo;Building Microservices&rdquo; by Sam Newman, and most of the advice given in the book resonated with Gabriele&rsquo;s talk, most of all in the issues that microservices can cause if not implemented properly. This discussion also remembered me that microservices are a tool, and that it all start with a good software design first (and second, third, fourth and so on 😅).</p>
<p>Be it an existing system or a greenfield project, it&rsquo;s important to decouple and separate the system properly before splitting it, and focusing on distributed systems&rsquo; issues and solutions (such as denormalization, async communication, event-based systems and so on) can make the difference.</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I’m writing a summary of my experience at the Italian Agile Days 2023.</p>
<p>I already wrote about the 2022 edition <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-italian-agile-days/"  target="_blank" >here</a> and, just like last time, I’m writing this summary 2 months after the event…but let’s not worry about this short delay.</p>
<p>This year, the event was organised at the Politecnico di Milano campus. I graduated there about 4 years ago, so it was a great occasion to return there! I got to see how the campus changed, and I met some old friends (at <a href="https://necst.it/"  target="_blank" >NECSTLab</a>) who stayed for their PhD.</p>
<p>Let’s start 💪</p>
<h2 id="first-day---unconference">First Day - Unconference</h2>
<p>The first day was dedicated to the unconference. An unconference (also called open space) is an event in which the agenda and the sessions are decided by the participants at the beginning of the day.</p>
<p>This was the second unconference I ever attended (after SoCraTes, which I described <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/socrates-2023/"  target="_blank" >here</a>), and I must admit that I’m starting to get addicted! They are a great way to get inspired and they cover a lot of themes and topics (less $$$ spent attending distinct conferences 😜).</p>

<figcaption class="caption">Friday’s unconference agenda</figcaption>

</figure></p>
<p>Here is a summary of the sessions I was able to attend.</p>
<p><em>A little disclaimer: I didn’t take many notes (and I’m writing these summaries after 2 months 😅), so even remembering the title is enough… you’ll notice during which session I took notes and which I did not 😂.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, I skipped some sessions and just went along with some other groups during the day. That’s the best part of unconferences: conversations just happen, and there are no limits to the discussions outside of the event itself!!</em></p>
<h3 id="unicorns---evolving-systems-where-to-find-them---alberto-acerbishttpswwwlinkedincominaacerbis">Unicorns - Evolving Systems, where to find them? - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aacerbis/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Acerbis</a></h3>
<p>In his session, Alberto gave an overview of how we can tackle the complexity of software design using Evolutionary Architectures.</p>
<p>When designing a system, we try to find a model that “fits” the problem we are trying to solve. However, the real world is complex (and sometimes chaotic), while software developers try to fit it into a clean, deterministic and simple model.</p>
<p>The guiding principle of Evolutionary Architecture is to perform guided, incremental, non-breaking changes across multiple dimensions (e.g. application and operations). Alberto then gave some links and concepts related to evolutionary architectures, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modularity (low coupling and high cohesion)</li>
<li>Using fitness functions to guide the evolution of the architecture</li>
<li>The tradeoff between DRY and WET software (is it always better to reduce duplication?)</li>
<li>Using different tools for different problems (no silver bullet)</li>
<li>Least Responsible Moment (delaying decisions when you have enough information)</li>
<li>“Laws” such as <em>Postel’s</em> and <em>Conway’s</em></li>
</ul>
<p>After his session, I had a lot to process (I just highlighted some of the arguments he explained), and it was a great overview of software architecture principles!</p>
<h3 id="how-to-stop-writing-unit-tests-and-be-happy---franco-lombardohttpswwwlinkedincominfrancolombardo">How to stop writing unit tests and be happy - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francolombardo/"  target="_blank" >Franco Lombardo</a></h3>
<p>Franco gave a session on how ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development) can help make us happier by writing easier tests.</p>
<p>ATDD is a flavour of TDD in which we develop a feature by starting with acceptance tests instead of standard unit tests. <em><strong>Acceptance tests</strong></em> are tests written from the perspective of the user and with the language used by the user/business. They are useful because when the test is green, then the user/business (and us) is happy and the functionality is implemented as specified (at least that’s how it should be).</p>
<p>In his session, Franco showed us that doing ATDD is easier than ever. He argued that testing with the real storage (db engine) is easy if the system is designed simply (e.g. without triggers, stored procedures or other complex stuff) and that persistence is not an “implementation detail” after all.</p>
<p>ATDD is not for everyone and every project, and he showed us the cases in which it shouldn’t be used (e.g., inexperienced developers, greenfield projects, UI-heavy applications, or projects too small or too big). In general, ATDD is a tool we can leverage in addition to the others.</p>
<p>I usually develop my tests using a similar approach (from the API controller to the DB, either in memory or in a small container) and find it useful, so Franco’s session confirmed my approach 👍 (even if there were a lot of discussions afterwards).</p>
<h3 id="legacy-code-theory-and-practice---andrea-franciahttpswwwlinkedincominandreafrancia">Legacy Code, theory and practice - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreafrancia/"  target="_blank" >Andrea Francia</a></h3>
<p>Andrea gave a lecture (a real one, with a blackboard and in a university campus!) on how to work with legacy code. In the end, he gave a very straightforward summary of the “Working Effectively with Legacy Code” book!</p>
<p>First, he started with some definitions of legacy code, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code without tests, or badly written tests (e.g. fragile, driven by the underlying implementation)</li>
<li>Code we are afraid to touch and modify</li>
</ul>
<p>After defining the enemy, Andrea showed us how to fight it. The way to do it is, of course, to add tests. But how do you add tests when the code doesn’t help (cannot refactor without test, cannot test without refactor)? We can use some techniques such as <strong>characterisation tests</strong>.</p>
<p>Basically, to test a legacy system we treat the system as a black bock driven by its I/Os (disk, DBs, network, external APIs etc..), and drive the I/O with tests to cover the piece of code we need to modify for the feature we have to develop. After covering the legacy code with enough tests, we can finally refactor it and start to develop the new feature.</p>
<p>Andrea told us about some cases that happened to him, such as testing using the log outputs to check that the system was behaving correctly. He also debunked the myth that we cannot use the debugger while doing TDD…with legacy code, everything is possible (and accepted).</p>
<p>Of the entire session I still remember a phase Andrea said: “Tests are like bets”. I think this sums up pretty well how I feel about tests and TDD in general. Every time I write a test, I’m betting that the system will behave in a certain way, and then correct my assumption (when doing characterisation tests) or the underlying implementation (during normal TDD) based on the test output.</p>

<p>Matteo is a Technical Principal at ToughtWorks, and in his session, he presented a problem he currently has: how do I train developers in how to use TDD, if they are already working full-time on different projects? I must admit I arrived late at this session, but just by watching the drawings there were a lot of ideas 😜</p>
<h3 id="pair-programming-discussion---angelo-ceccatohttpswwwlinkedincominangeloceccato">Pair Programming discussion - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeloceccato/"  target="_blank" >Angelo Ceccato</a></h3>
<p>Angelo proposed an open discussion about pair programming. In a small group, we discussed what pair programming means for us, if and how we are using it at work and what are the advantages, disadvantages and common issues with it. I don’t pair often (and never in the “canonical” way at least), and hearing the stories of other developers was interesting, from people who do it every day and for more than half of their workday, to others who are sceptic about some of its implementation, and to others (like me) who never did it apart from emergencies and workshops.</p>
<h2 id="second-day---conference">Second Day - Conference</h2>
<p>The second day was a standard conference, held in a single Polimi building (n. 3 to be precise).</p>
<p>After arriving at the main campus and finding the entrance (on Saturday all secondary entrances are closed it seems 🤔), it was time to grab the goodies bag, buy the conference T-shirt and finally attend the main event!</p>
<p>Here is the usual (incomplete) list of talks I watched (and some notes when I took them).</p>
<h3 id="e-non-ci-indurre-in-tentazione-ma-liberaci-dal-bug---marco-fracassihttpswwwlinkedincominmarco-fracassi">E non ci indurre in tentazione, ma liberaci dal bug - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-fracassi/"  target="_blank" >Marco Fracassi</a></h3>
<p>In his talk, Marco explained how emergent design can help keep a codebase clean, maintainable and close to the domain of the business.</p>
<p>He started with a definition of emergent design and its advantages (e.g. non-speculative, working in small steps, refactoring and simple design), then he went on showing how legacy code has little to none of that!!</p>
<p>Most legacy code contains recurrent (anti)patterns that push it far away from the domain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layered architecture (code divided by layer instead of features)</li>
<li>Anaemic objects</li>
<li>Big Services doing everything</li>
<li>Dependency Injection with a lot of scattered containers (10+ parameters constructors anyone?)</li>
<li>Behaviour separate from the data (which is caused by all the above)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long run, these issues affect most legacy systems and lead to unmaintainable code. To make it worse, the problem is not caused by the framework or language (and we love so much to blame the language!).</p>
<p>To solve these issues, Marco proposed some solutions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing repositories to separate domain and persistence</li>
<li>Extracting (domain-based) use cases from big services, to separate responsibilities and make a set of smaller, cleaner functionalities</li>
<li>Bringing data and behaviour closed by using domain objects (again, bringing code away from big services)</li>
<li>Splitting read and write procedures (usually removing useless use cases, most of all in the read part)</li>
<li>Writing tests and add coverage (remembering that coverage itself is not fundamental, but tests can act as a “parachute”)</li>
<li>“contamination”, through pair/mob programming and shared learning</li>
</ul>
<p>The main takeaway from his talk is that the design can emerge if we work in small steps, keeping the domain as central in the application and bringing data and behaviour close together (as in DDD).</p>
<p>Marco just started his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ImprovingCode"  target="_blank" >ImprovingCode</a> (in Italian) in which he talks about these (and other) topic, check it out!!</p>
<h3 id="bdd-molto-più-che-testing---fabio-cocchihttpswwwlinkedincominfabiococchi">BDD: Molto più che testing - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiococchi/"  target="_blank" >Fabio Cocchi</a></h3>
<p>Gathering requirements for a feature or a product is always difficult. We can write all the specifications we want, but then, as developers, we are left alone to implement them.</p>
<p>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) is an agile methodology that enables customers and developers to collaborate on the requirements process. It involves writing a verifiable specification that can be used as acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>Fabio introduced us to this world and its main principles and ingredients. In particular, he described the process of using <strong>behaviours</strong> to model the system requirements and how it helps in delivering value to the business more quickly and with fewer iterations. By writing acceptance criteria using a shared language, developers and customers can communicate effectively and understand the domain together, resulting in higher quality and faster delivery.</p>
<h3 id="tdd-e-il-mito-del-100-code-coverage---gianni-bombellihttpswwwlinkedincomingianni-bombelli-manuela-munarettohttpswwwlinkedincominmanuelamunaretto">TDD e il mito del 100% code coverage - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli/"  target="_blank" >Gianni Bombelli</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelamunaretto/"  target="_blank" >Manuela Munaretto</a></h3>
<p>Gianni and Manuela staged a great theatrical show, in which two developers discuss a bug they found in their team codebase.</p>
<p>The twist is that the buggy code has 100% test coverage! How is it possible?</p>
<p>During their session, Gianni and Manuela showed that code coverage isn’t the best metric to follow when writing tests, and that it’s more important to write proper tests (asserting the behaviour of the system, and not only blinding covering lines…).
I didn’t take any notes because I couldn’t stop laughing during the session 😂 it was great, and in the end, they were able to find and fix the bug (and then they lived happily ever after).</p>
<h3 id="just-commit-to-master-please---how-to-actually-implement-ci---daniele-scilliahttpswwwlinkedincomindaniele-scillia">Just Commit to master, please - How to actually implement CI - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniele-scillia/"  target="_blank" >Daniele Scillia</a></h3>
<p>Daniele showed <em><strong>why</strong></em> and <em><strong>how</strong></em> to implement Continuous Integration the right way, using Trunk-Based Development. I like how he compared the usual pull-request model with trunk-based development and why they have different use cases (open source software the first, usual product development the latter).</p>
<p>I didn’t take notes, so I’ll just give you a link to Daniele’s <a href="https://danthedev.carrd.co/"  target="_blank" >website</a>.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend his newsletter, <a href="https://learnagilepractices.substack.com/"  target="_blank" >Learn Agile Practices</a>, in which he explains agile practices (technical and not),  each week. I’ve been following him since the beginning of 2023, and every new post was great 👍.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-culture-of-sw-craftsmanship---michele-brissonihttpswwwlinkedincominmichelebrissoni">Building a culture of SW Craftsmanship - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelebrissoni/"  target="_blank" >Michele Brissoni</a></h3>
<p>In his talk, Michele presented the <a href="https://swcraftsmanshipdojo.com/"  target="_blank" >SW Craftmanship Dojo</a>, a platform in which he teaches the principles and techniques of software craftmanship with a holistic approach.</p>
<p>The dojo trains students by using techniques taken from the world of martial arts (of which Michele himself is a very expert practitioner). Students learn eXtreme Programming concepts (all the *DDs out there), DevOps and Infrastructure/SRE stuff and also product-related topics, making theme all-around professional software craftsmen.</p>
<p>His talk was really interesting and showed that I still have A LOT to learn in order to be a real  professional 😅</p>
<h3 id="in-between-talks">In between talks…</h3>
<p>While taking a break, I decided to not follow any talk and just roam around the conference.</p>
<p>While wandering around my old university halls, I stumbled upon some people from <a href="https://qmates.tech/"  target="_blank" >QMates</a> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/qmates/"  target="_blank" >linkedin</a>) who just took an empty lecture room as hostage and started doing the <a href="https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata"  target="_blank" >bank kata</a> on the small desks used by students.</p>
<p>It was a great moment, as I watched a mob discussing the proper way to develop and test REST endpoints for a fake bank account service in a university room… it couldn’t get better 😁</p>
<p>These are exactly the reasons why I prefer in-presence conferences to their online version…</p>
<h3 id="come-funziona-il-cevello-di-un-programmatore-quando-impara-e-affronta-nuovi-problemi---pietro-roversihttpswwwlinkedincominpietro-roversi-61070527-slideshttpswwwslidesharenetpietroroversi3come-funziona-il-cervello-di-un-programmatore-quando-impara-e-affronta-nuovi-problemipdf">Come funziona il cevello di un programmatore quando impara e affronta nuovi problemi? - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pietro-roversi-61070527/"  target="_blank" >Pietro Roversi</a> (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/PietroRoversi3/come-funziona-il-cervello-di-un-programmatore-quando-impara-e-affronta-nuovi-problemipdf"  target="_blank" >slides</a>)</h3>
<p>How does our brain work, and how can we exploit it to work with code better?</p>
<p>Pietro introduced us to the magical world of our brain. He talked about memory, cognitive load, knowledge and flow, and how everything impacts our work as developers.</p>
<p>For example, short-term and working memory are essential to keep a flow state, and we can improve our flow by learning the syntax and some of the documentation of our languages and frameworks (which we never do 😂). This also allows to reduce interruptions (google searches which become a rabbit-hole of surfing the web in various ways) .</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that working memory is involved in a process called chunking (dividing and storing information in chunks), and with more experience comes better chunking… so, reading more code (and having more experience) allows senior developers to remember it better than the juniors 🤯.</p>
<p>Pietro’s talk was full of these insights, and I enjoyed the explanation behind how our brain works!</p>
<h3 id="navigando-nel-mondo-del-software-tra-modelli-e-realtà---ferdinando-santacrocehttpswwwlinkedincominferdinandosantacroce-marco-massarottohttpswwwlinkedincominmassama">Navigando nel mondo del software, tra modelli e realtà - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinandosantacroce/"  target="_blank" >Ferdinando Santacroce</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/massama/"  target="_blank" >Marco Massarotto</a></h3>
<p>The last talk I attended was given by Marco and Ferdinando. Together, they explored the difference between models and the reality of software development.</p>
<p>In their talk they linked various arguments and topics (from User Stories to technical debt and the definition of Ubiquitous Language in DDD) to highlight that we operate in a world of approximations.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this session (as I did with Ferdinando’s session <a href="https://vimeo.com/768881541"  target="_blank" >last year</a>) because it reached full circle with the first session I attended the day before (given by Alberto Acerbis, see above) in showing the importance of modelling and facing approximations in our job as developers.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The conference was great!</p>
<p>Last year was my first time and I had some trouble meeting people and just enjoying the event.</p>
<p>This time, after participating in the community a bit more, I was able to attend the conference with a different mindset and just enjoy it.</p>
<p>The fact that the conference was held on the Politecnico campus was the cherry on top: I was finally able to visit the campus again after 4 years and sink into the memories (both good…and bad 😅) of my university years.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what next year brings in terms of events, and to keep learning!</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to the last post of 2023!</p>
<p>As already done <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/"  target="_blank" >last year</a>, it’s time for a end-of-year recap!</p>
<p>I usually spend the last days of the year eating and laying on the couch (christmas is strong in italy) so don’t expect a long post.</p>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="2023-goals-review">2023 Goals Review</h2>
<p>First, a short check on the goals I wrote in my 2022 review:</p>
<p><strong>❓Learn in public</strong></p>
<p>I definitely tried to expose myself a little more and share what I learned in public. Some examples are my blog posts on books I read (<a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/atomic-habits-book/"  target="_blank" >here</a>, <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/philosophy-of-software-design/"  target="_blank" >here</a> and <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/indistractable-book-summary/"  target="_blank" >here</a>), and the github repos for <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/adventofcode"  target="_blank" >Advent Of Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/coding-challenges"  target="_blank" >Coding Challenges</a>.</p>
<p>I left a question mark because I think I could have done more this year, and there’s room for improvement.</p>
<p>❓ <strong>Improve as a Backend Developer</strong></p>
<p>Another goal, another question mark. Even though I got better at working on the backend (e.g. I just read <em>Building Microservices</em> and two books on DDD) I didn’t work much with backend systems in the last months, focusing more on device communication (e.g. serial port, BLE) and GUIs (in windows) instead of web applications.</p>
<p>This will definitely change next year (see below for why…spoiler: in my new job I’ll work mostly on web applications 😛).</p>
<p><strong>✅ Attend more meetups and conferences</strong></p>
<p>This is a green flag! I attended a lot of conferences and meetups this year. This helped my in meeting a lot of people and technologies. I documented some of the events in this blog, so make sure to give it a look 😁</p>
<p><strong>✅ Take care of my body and mind</strong></p>
<p>The first half of the year was meh (I reached 100Kg and didn’t exercise), but it got better in the second half: I started to watch more what I eat and started exercising a bit, and right now I’m about 92Kg with a tiny bit of fat less than before 😅.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Let’s deep dive into some aspects of this year, starting with my job as a software engineer/developer/whatever.</p>
<p>The year started with a long-running project finally coming to an end. We finished it by testing with the customer for a last time…..in japan! I went to Okinawa for the tests, and mainland Japan for the final review of the project. In the end, the customer was satisfied by our work and I managed to visit a small japanese town (even if it was just for a day)! I also managed to see sakura trees blooming even if it was march.</p>

<p>From April to October I worked for <a href="https://weart.it/"  target="_blank" >WeArt</a>, a small startup inside e-Novia focusing on haptics for Virtual/Augmented reality. In particular, I worked on their low-level SDK (e.g. <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/docs-as-code-doxygen-awesome/"  target="_blank" >improving the documentation</a>) and their Middleware software (a WinUI/UWP app to communicate with their device).</p>
<p>In WeArt I learned to be more proactive in my work. Being in a small, product-oriented startup shifted my actions from just doing what I was told (common in consulting firms) to actively thinking on how to improve the product itself (in my case, the SDK and Middleware).</p>

<p>Finally, in December I started a new journey in <a href="https://www.zupit.it/"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>!</p>
<p>Zupit is a small software house in Trento (Italy) which focuses on agility, code quality, learning and work-life balance. The most interesting aspect of my new job is that I’m working only 6 hours per day (part-time) without compromising on productivity.</p>
<p>The work is fast but already rewarding, even after just 1 month since I started: working less hours has led to improved productivity (we still have to ship the same amount!) and to more focus during working hours. In addition to that, I have time to learn, exercise and relax in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I just started, but can’t wait to get more involved in my new job!</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>It’s been one year since I started this blog!</p>
<p>Overall, I’m satisfied with how the blog is going. I wrote 13 posts in 2023 including this one (not listing them here, you can visit the blog instead 😛), so on average I published one post each month.</p>
<p>Most of the posts are about experiences I had (e.g. conferences, meetups and so on) and on books I read and summarised. I still don’t think I have a lot to say on the technical side that hasn’t been covered by someone else (impostor syndrome will always be there for me), but I hope to improve my writing and my habits.</p>
<p>One thing I struggled with in 2023 was consistency. I wrote most of the posts in batches (so 2 or 3 at a time) and then postponed their publication to fit the goal of “one post each month”. In November and December I ended up with no post scheduled and I didn’t write anything in that period, and that’s why this is the first post in 2 months….</p>
<p>In 2024 I hope to focus and write more on this blog. Also, I hope to improve my content, adding more technical/programming stuff to the more “journal-style” posts I wrote this year.</p>
<h2 id="conferences-and-meetups">Conferences and Meetups</h2>
<p>This year I finally got the courage to get out and attend some conferences and meetups! I mostly stayed in my zone (physically, meaning Bergamo, Milan and northern italy in general) and attended local events, but I also adventured outside Italy once (for FOSDEM).</p>
<p>Here’s the list of conferences I attended in 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudgen.it/codegen/"  target="_blank" >CodeGen</a> - Verona</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/"  target="_blank" >FOSDEM</a> - Bruxelles → <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-my-fosdem-experience/"  target="_blank" >My Experience</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ugidotnet.org/e/3087/Web-Day-2023"  target="_blank" >Web Day 2023</a> - Online</li>
<li><a href="https://agilemovement.it/venture/2023/pordenone/"  target="_blank" >Agile Venture</a> - Pordenone</li>
<li><a href="https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/index.html"  target="_blank" >Working Software Conference</a> - Milan → <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/working-software-2023/"  target="_blank" >My Experience</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.socrates-conference.it/"  target="_blank" >SoCraTeS</a> - Rimini → <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/socrates-2023/"  target="_blank" >My Experience</a></li>
<li><a href="https://conferences.codemotion.com/milan2023-live/"  target="_blank" >Codemotion</a> - Milan</li>
<li><a href="https://www.agileday.it/"  target="_blank" >Italian Agile Days</a> - Milan</li>
</ul>
<p>I also took part in some meetups (again, near Bergamo and Milan). I love meetups as they are smaller and more relaxed than a conference. Meeting the organisers and the speakers over a beer after or during the meetup is 100 times easier than at a big conference!!</p>
<p>Some of the meetups I usually attend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/xpugbg/"  target="_blank" >XPUG Bergamo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/edotechtalks-milan/"  target="_blank" >Tech Talks by eDreams</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/react-js-milano/"  target="_blank" >ReactJS Milano</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/ugidotnet/"  target="_blank" >.NET Italian User Group</a> (UGIdotNet)</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I regret about 2023 is that I attended all these events “passively”, without ever proposing as a speaker… I don’t want to make bold claims and become a speaker in 2024, but moving towards that might be the goal (e.g. speaking at company events, or through this blog or… who knows, youtube or something similar 😅).</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I love reading, both fiction and non-fiction books. Reading allows me to disconnect, relax and either learn something new or distract myself with a good story.</p>
<p>This year I read a bit less than last year (28 books instead of 32). Here’s the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Noise</em> by Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein</li>
<li><em>Soundtracks: The Surprising Solution to Overthinking</em> by Jon Acuff</li>
<li><em>#Freestyle</em> by Roberto Ottolino</li>
<li><em>Cronache di Domain Driven Design</em> by Various Authors (see more <a href="https://www.avanscoperta.it/it/libri/"  target="_blank" >here</a>)</li>
<li><em>The War of Art</em> by Steven Pressfield</li>
<li><em>The Every</em> by Dave Eggers</li>
<li><em>Solo</em> by Rebecca Seal</li>
<li><em>La Piena (Blackwater I)</em> by Michael McDowell</li>
<li><em>Matematica Rock</em> by Paolo Alessandrini</li>
<li><em>Decision-making for Software Development Teams</em> by Francesco Strazzullo</li>
<li><em>Less is more: sull’arte di non avere niente</em> by Salvatore La Porta</li>
<li><em>Indistractable</em> by Nir Eyal (my review <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/indistractable-book-summary/"  target="_blank" >here</a>)</li>
<li><em>Le coordinate della felicità</em> by Gianluca Gotto</li>
<li><em>The Elegant Universe</em> by Brian Greene</li>
<li><em>Developer Hegemony</em> by Erik Dietrich</li>
<li><em>Domain Driven Design Distilled</em> by Vaughn Vernon</li>
<li><em>The Master Key</em> by Togawa Masako</li>
<li><em>Show Your Work!</em> by Austin Kleon (currently writing a summary of it!)</li>
<li><em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em> by Michael C. Feathers</li>
<li><em>The Obstacle is The Way</em> by Ryan Holiday</li>
<li><em>The Arc</em> by Ben Oliver</li>
<li><em>Upheaval: How Nations Cope with Crisis and Change</em> by Jared Diamond</li>
<li><em>So good they can’t ignore you</em> by Cal Newport</li>
<li><em>Building Microservices</em> by Sam Newman</li>
<li><em>Thinking Better. The Art of the Shortcut</em> by Marcus Du Sautoy</li>
<li><em>Tokyo tutto l’anno</em> by Laura Imai Messina</li>
<li><em>Fooled by Randomness</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</li>
<li><em>Make Shift: Dispatches from the Post-Pandemic Future</em> edited by Gideon Lichfield</li>
<li><em><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Critica Portatile al Visual Design</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></em> (Portable Critique to Visual Design) by Riccardo Falcinelli</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s a list of the books I didn’t finish… I must say, they are less than last year, but it might be because I read less overall.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>LSD, my problem child</em> by Albert Hofmann</li>
<li><em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius (I try to go back to it sometimes, but I stopped reading it months ago)</li>
<li><em>Irriducibile</em> by Federico Faggin (really interesting, but also a bit criptic)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the list I can see that most of my readings are non-fiction (I read only 5/6 fiction books) and programming-related books. Usually, when I read I do it either to learn something or to get inspired. As I already wrote last year, I have the bad habit of not taking notes often enough, so I don’t recall much of what I read. I hope to get better next year….</p>
<p>Also, next year I hope I’ll read so much that putting a list here won’t have sense anymore 😛</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>Last year I bought and moved to my home with my girlfriend and her cat. The only notable thing I did this year was to finally attach lamps to the walls (instead of letting the lightbulbs dangling 😅). I also bought some furniture and improved my home office (thanks Zupit for that 😛).</p>
<p>A sad note before thinking about my goals for next year: in July, our cat Lucky passed away 😢. He had been with my girlfriend for 8 years and with me for the last year and half. We discovered he had heart issues during the christmas holidays in 2022, and even though he got better during the winter and spring, in the summer he got worse and we had to let him go.</p>
<p>See you Lucky 😢</p>

<h2 id="new-years-resolutions">New Year’s resolutions</h2>
<p>I don’t like setting goals at the end of the year. Christmas Holidays allow me to relax and dream of impossible goals and futures in which everything is perfect and goes according to plans, but reality is never like this.</p>
<p>Still…. let’s make some new year’s resolutions for 2024 😅</p>
<p>For 2024 I have some goals in mind. Last year I wrote too much, so let’s keep it short.</p>
<p>Here’s the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write</strong> more regularly on the blog (every 2 weeks?) and more about programming (still keeping “journal-style” posts)</li>
<li>More <strong>exercise</strong> (2 times a week instead of one) and getting in shape (85 kg or less)</li>
<li><strong>Speak</strong> somewhere! Even a small meetup or internal company talks is enough to start</li>
<li>Improve on the <strong>entire stack</strong> (my new job title is “Full-Stack developer” now, so I better start learning those damned frontend frameworks!)</li>
<li>(Again) Attend <strong>conferences</strong> and <strong>meetups</strong> like I did in 2023</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>That’s all! 2023 was great. I met new people, changed job and learned a lot.</p>
<p>I hope 2024 will be better, for me and also for you!</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi! 👋 Welcome to a new post.</p>
<p>On October 19-21, I attended the SoCraTes (un)conference in Rimini. With over 90 people, we gathered to talk about software crafting, testing, and all related (and unrelated) stuff 😛.</p>
<p>The event was fantastic! I met a lot of new people, gained insights into my current and future learning, and had some interesting (and crazy) discussions (such as discovering the niche of custom keyboards and firmware 🤩)!!!</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to give a brief summary of what an unconference is and the sessions I attended during the event.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-open-space">What is an Open Space?</h2>
<p>SoCraTes is a unique event because of its interesting format, called Open Space (or Unconference).</p>
<p>In a standard conference, everything is decided up-front: there is a call-for-papers, speakers and the agenda are decided beforehand, there are frontal sessions and workshops, etc. Basically, the attendees just need to come and watch what&rsquo;s offered by the conference organizing committee.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in an Open Space, the format, agenda, and topics discussed are decided by the participants during the event itself. This choice comes from the observation that, during a conference, the most inspiring and interesting stuff happens during coffee breaks and in the common areas. So why don&rsquo;t we transform the entire event into a big coffee break?</p>
<p>On every day of the Open Space, the participants gather to propose and decide the daily agenda: everyone can propose a talk, workshop, discussion, or any other type of activity (even a walking discussion on the beach 😎 or a party game). After the proposals, it&rsquo;s time for the <strong>marketplace</strong>: everyone can ask the session organizer to move the session (to a different time and location) or to change/expand the topic. The important thing is that only the one who proposed the session can change it!</p>
<p>After the marketplace has ended and the agenda is ready, the unconference can start. During the event, there is only one rule to follow, called the &ldquo;rule of two feet&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not contributing or adding value to the session, you can move elsewhere freely.</p></blockquote>
<p>This rule is not confined to the pre-defined sessions. Participants can move between sessions, stay in common areas, or look for other people to start impromptu activities! That&rsquo;s the beauty of the open space format.</p>
<p>Given that they can freely move during the event, participants usually divide into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Butterflies: they like to move a lot and cross-pollinate the discussions.</li>
<li>Bumblebees: they stay in the same room for the entire duration of the session, bringing stability and continuity to the discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the rule of two feet generates four principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoever comes is the right people.</li>
<li>Whenever it starts is the right time.</li>
<li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could happen.</li>
<li>When it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s over.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rule of two feet and the four principles above allow the participants to express themselves in many ways and encourage collaboration and open discussions throughout the event. That&rsquo;s what brought me to attend it!</p>
<h2 id="my-experience-at-socrates-it-2023">My experience at SoCraTes-IT 2023</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief summary of my experience at SoCraTes 2023. I didn&rsquo;t take many notes and pictures, so most of the descriptions below might be incomplete or plain wrong. This is more of a journaling exercise for me.</p>
<p>Given this disclaimer, if you find any errors, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me (or open an issue/PR on my website <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/marcobacis.github.io"  target="_blank" >repository</a> on GitHub 😛).</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>The first day was just for networking and getting to know the other participants. I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, and then we had a happy hour, dinner, and a brief &ldquo;ice-breaker&rdquo; game.</p>
<p>We divided into groups, and each group had to introduce itself with a given description. My group had to decide if &ldquo;casual Friday&rdquo; was still a thing in the 2020s. We named our group &ldquo;Eat My Shorts&rdquo; and gave a short presentation on it. However, there was no interaction or any &ldquo;theatrical&rdquo; performance, and only one of us spoke, while other groups put on a show and moved around a lot. A reminder for next time: have more interaction between group members (try to talk 😅) and make the presentation funnier!!</p>
<p>After the ice breaker, I went to my room early because I hadn&rsquo;t been feeling well since the morning and needed to recharge for the next days.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>Friday was the first day of the Unconference!</p>
<p>We met in the hotel hall to have the first “marketplace”. Everyone interested/inspired attached a post-it with his/her session proposal. Then, we decided the rooms and time for each session.</p>

<p>Here’s a brief description on the sessions I was able to participate (even for a few minutes):</p>
<p><strong>Game AI and Montecarlo Tree Search - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteovaccari/"  target="_blank" >Matteo Vaccari</a></strong></p>
<p>In this session, Matteo taught us what a Monte Carlo search is and how it is useful for searching in very large decision trees. A perfect example of this was the game &ldquo;Commands&amp;Colors&rdquo; with some parts of the game having a million branch factor!</p>
<p>This was a preliminary test for his talk, which he gave a few days later at Codemotion. I wasn&rsquo;t able to see his entire session at SoCraTes, but I watched his talk at Codemotion and it was great!</p>
<p>For more information (and slides/code), visit <a href="https://matteo.vaccari.name/"  target="_blank" >Matteo&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Programmer’s Brain - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrctst/"  target="_blank" >Marco Testa</a></strong></p>
<p>In this session, Marco presented what he learned reading the book “<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain"  target="_blank" >The Programmer’s Brain</a>” by Felienne Hermans.</p>
<p>The main concept we discussed was <strong>cognitive load</strong> and ways in which it affects software developers. The book provides many concepts and ways to reduce this cognitive load and make the code we develop easier to understand and remember. Many of the techniques have already been discussed in other books (e.g. clean code), but here they were related to cognitive load and all of its aspects.</p>
<p>The session was really interesting. Having attended a course on memory techniques some years ago I already knew some of the concepts presented, although not applied to software development.</p>
<p><strong>Stop fighting useless battles: automate code style, architecture compliance and refactoring - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robfrank/"  target="_blank" >Roberto Franchini</a></strong></p>
<p>Roberto gave this talk at the <a href="https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/"  target="_blank" >Working Software Conference</a> in June. I didn&rsquo;t see it at that time, but fortunately, he gave it again at SoCraTes! His talk was about ways to automate boring tasks that are quite important to keep a codebase clean among team members.</p>
<p>In particular, he presented:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pre-commit.com/"  target="_blank" >pre-commit</a>: a tool to boost commit hooks and CI pipelines, with various tasks and plugins from the community. He uses it to check certain rules, such as passwords and keys, fixing line endings, and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.archunit.org/"  target="_blank" >ArchUnit</a>: a tool to unit-test your architecture. It can be used to enforce separation between modules, check that the code doesn&rsquo;t import certain packages, and generally standardize and test the code architecture.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.openrewrite.org/"  target="_blank" >OpenRewrite</a>: allows for large-scale code refactoring, such as framework/API migrations, code cleanup, and other community-driven code transformations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about any of these tools, so it was a very inspiring talk!</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Trunk-Based Development - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabio-fortini/"  target="_blank" >Fabio Fortini</a></strong></p>
<p>After lunch, while everyone was feeling sleepy, Fabio ignited our fighting spirit by presenting a controversial argument: should we use trunk-based development in our projects?</p>
<p>He showed us a presentation he had given to his team in 2021 to convince them of the pros (without having used it before), and then gave his opinion after having done it for a few months.</p>
<p>The discussion was filled with arguments from both parties, and essentially Fabio stopped talking and (unintentionally) handed the stage over to the group.</p>
<p>It was an interesting discussion nonetheless: in the end, trunk-based development can be used as a teaching tool to help the team learn to work with small releases and continuously integrate into the main branch. Afterward, or if the team is already mature enough, small, frequently integrated branches can also be used (and are actually compatible with the trunk-based definition!).</p>
<p><strong>The Training Crafter - To read or not to read? - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiarabarbagianni/"  target="_blank" >Chiara Barbagianni</a></strong></p>
<p>The topic of the session was learning. Should we learn by reading or by doing, and can the two worlds work together?</p>
<p>Chiara gave a free-flowing presentation to our small group, starting with a survey and then writing on a whiteboard (and a lot of post-it notes) to decide how to merge the two opposing views.</p>
<p>She divided the board into 4 quadrants along 2 axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice (doing something practical, or reading about it?)</li>
<li>Taste (developing a taste for what you are learning, or doing it just for the money?)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end, Chiara presented how she&rsquo;s doing it in the <a href="https://handbook.agilelab.it/BookClub.html"  target="_blank" >Agile Lab Book Club</a>: instead of mandating all members to read a given chapter every time, the format is more generic. Every two weeks, the club curators propose a topic: members can explore it in any way (the recommended book, videos, blogs, anything) and post their learnings on a shared board. At the end of the two-week period, they share what they learned in a short training session.</p>
<p>I loved this session! The way it was kept was fantastic, and we were immersed in Chiara&rsquo;s mind throughout the entire duration of the discussion. That&rsquo;s exactly what I expected from an unconference.</p>

<p><strong>Monads for the Rest of us (in C#)  - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arialdomartini/"  target="_blank" >Arialdo Martini</a></strong></p>
<p>Even after studying it at the university, I still find it difficult to understand most functional programming concepts. But thanks to Arialdo, now I can understand it a bit more.</p>
<p>In his session, he started to implement monads (the most difficult concept in FP to me) in plain C#. Starting from function composition, passing through functors and implementing the IO monad, he tried to explain to the folks that we are how functional programming concepts map to an object oriented language.</p>
<p>His session was based on a series of posts <a href="https://arialdomartini.github.io/monads-for-the-rest-of-us"  target="_blank" >on his website</a>, that I will definitely try to follow to learn all there is about monads!</p>
<p><strong>Friday evening special: Oggetti a Teatro” (Objects on Stage) - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrctst/"  target="_blank" >Marco Testa</a></strong></p>
<p>Unlike many conferences, the party didn’t finish after dinner. Instead, there were 2 parallel sessions. One was a NIX installation party at the pub, while the other was a high-class evening at the theatre.</p>
<p>Marco wrote and gave life to a set of characters (I still remember the <em>Duke of Client</em>, the <em>Count of Receiver</em>, and <em>Invoker the spy</em>!) that together and with their actions formed the perfect description of the Command Pattern. He basically wrote the script of a design pattern, highlighting the behaviour of the different component and their scope. Also, the story was pretty engaging!</p>
<p>Even if short, the <em>opera</em> was well received by the public, and I think it would be a great way to explain design patterns in a memorable way.</p>
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p>Second day of Unconference. We started immediately with the session proposals and marketplace, as there was less time than Friday (the event finished at 17).</p>

<p><strong><del>Coping</del>/Coding with Product - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brando/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Brandolini</a></strong></p>
<p>In this session, Alberto continued the discussion started on friday (which unfortunately I didn’t attend…) on how developers can work together with the product/business side without headaches or creating “dirty” code.</p>
<p>He started by re-defining technical debt (which he deemed a wrong analogy) with its opposite, <strong>Design Integrity</strong>: “how much the current codebase fits its purpose” or how much the code is ready for the next change.</p>
<p>He went on explaining how product side is based on “experiments”, as the roadmap is not as clearly defined as we developers would like the code to be. How can we make the two ends meet? Our work as technical people is to work on “safe bets” from a good design to another good design, without reducing the design integrity.</p>
<p>The group went on a discussion on changes of which I didn’t take note, so writing it here would be useless.</p>
<p>In the end, the core idea is that developers should work together with product to define different “purposes” (either core or not to the business) and isolate these choices in distinct bounded contexts and components, to reduce the possible damage given by continuous product experiments.</p>
<p>This is not a set process, but can evolve based on the product (e.g. a context might get split in multiple services, or multiple services merged because they follow the same purpose…).</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, Alberto wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@ziobrando/from-technical-debt-to-design-integrity-48e7056b6776"  target="_blank" >post</a> in which he explains these concepts in a much cleaner way than me 😅</p>
<p><strong>Refactoring with CQRS (without events) - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucagiovenzana/"  target="_blank" >Luca Giovenzana</a></strong></p>
<p>Luca showed how they refactored the backend for their startup (<a href="https://golee.it/"  target="_blank" >golee</a>) using CQRS, but without using event sourcing as everyone doing CQRS is doing right now. Basically, the team at golee migrated some functionality to the new, greenfield codebase which was used as <em>write model</em>, while keeping the old (legacy) code as <em>read model</em> and as a backup, by writing to it using a hook.</p>
<p>By keeping the system simple (no events and event sourcing) they were able to keep both systems running, without impacting on their ability to extend it and improving performances.</p>
<p>His session was a nice look at how to take tradeoffs, which are essential when running a startup!</p>
<p><strong>Create a Macropad for fun!! - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli/"  target="_blank" >Gianni Bombelli</a></strong></p>
<p>During the breaks and dinners on thursday and friday I was introduced to the world of custom keyboards. It’s a world full of crazy people talking about layouts, layers and keys. When Gianni put a post-it named “Create a macropad for FUN!” I couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>In his session, he showed us his “hobby” project, a custom mechanical macropad to help him during training sessions, in which he uses a graphics tablet and might need some ready-to-use shortcuts (e.g. to delete the latest line drawn, to open an application, to use git).</p>
<p>His session was a deep-dive in how to build a custom keyboard, from the PCB up to the customisation with QMK and a bit of C programming. Now I really want a custom macropad!! I’ll wait for the “BomboPad” to enter the market 😛</p>
<p><strong>Orthogonality of TDD, SOLID, FP - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteobaglini/"  target="_blank" >Matteo Baglini</a></strong></p>
<p>In his session, Matteo showed us how TDD, SOLID principles and Functional Programming are related. He implemented the password validator kata, doing small steps by following TDD and doing it in a functional way.</p>
<p>I came into the session while it was already started so I lost most of the context. Fortunately, Matteo shared the <a href="https://github.com/matteobaglini/orthogonality-socrates-it-2023"  target="_blank" >repo</a> containing the kata implementation, with every small step of the red-green-refactor process explained in separate commits! A great way to visualize TDD in action.</p>
<p><strong>PKMS/Note Taking - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagasantagostino/"  target="_blank" >Jaga Santagostino</a></strong></p>
<p>The final session I attended was an open discussion about Obsidian and Personal Knowledge Management Systems (PKMS) in general.</p>
<p>Jaga showed us the many features in Obsidian and tried to compare it with another famous PKMS application, Notion.</p>
<p>While presenting, other participants asked questions and gave their opinions. For example I learned about another tool, called logseq, which is quite similar to obsidian.</p>
<p>In the end I gave obsidian a try. I actually used it to take notes during the unconference, and to take notes at the Codemotion conference the week later. I now found out how to share my notes with git, so from now on I’ll try to use it instead of Notion! It’s local-first paradigm is very useful when working offline, and the backlinks and graph view are really interesting and allow to link ideas together. Also, is definitely faster than notion 😅.</p>
<p>Thanks Jaga for this discovery!</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End!</h2>
<p>SoCraTes was a great event! I met new people, learned a lot and had fun, the perfect combination    for a conference.</p>
<p>I came home with a lot of new concepts, tools and inspiration, and I cannot wait for the next event like this (which will be the <a href="https://www.agileday.it/"  target="_blank" >2023 Agile Day</a> Unconference, on Nov. 17 😛).</p>
<p>As always, thanks for all the participants, to the sponsors, organizer and everyone involved. The most meaningful connections happen in a free and creative environment, and that’s exactly what SoCraTes is.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this long and boring summary, I hope to have shown (even a bit) all I saw and felt during the event. If you find anything to correct (e.g. about your session, about my grammar, or if I forgot something) just contact me via mail or linkedin, or open an issue on this website repository on github.</p>
<p>As always, see you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to enjoy writing short summaries about books I read, so here&rsquo;s a new one 😛</p>
<p><strong>Indistractable</strong> is a book by <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/"  target="_blank" >Nir Eyal</a>, a <em>behavioural engineer</em> who worked and studied the psychology of our attention and applied it to digital product and advertisements. In fact, his first book (”Hooked”) is about the design of habit-forming products (such as games, ads, apps and so on).</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read this first book, but it&rsquo;s right next on my reading list!</p>
<p>If in his fist book he unveiled how products make us “distractable” and easily influenced (looking at you, Facebook and TikTok!). This book is instead the complete opposite, as Nir explains all the strategies and behaviours we can adopt to <em>regain our attention</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-we-be-indistractable">Why should we be “indistractable”?</h2>
<p>Nowadays, distractions are everywhere: TV, smartphones and social networks are just the tip of the iceberg in the ways our mind tries to distract herself. But the issue is not only technological, and it has deeper roots in our psyche.</p>
<p>Distraction brings us away from what&rsquo;s important: it can be studying and working, but also having meaningful relationships (do you remember the last time you “really” talked with someone, without turning your smartphone screen on?).</p>
<p>We want to do the right things, but we should also learn how to avoid the <em>wrong</em> ones, and distraction is one of the bad things pulling us away from our actions.</p>
<p>So, being <strong>indistractable</strong> can be considered a superpower, which allows us to be present and more productive, and in general better people.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-become-indistractable">How to become indistractable?</h2>
<p>Our actions can be pulled by two forces: distraction (moving away from what we want) and traction (moving towards our goals). To become indistractable means to follow traction! Traction and distraction are the <strong>outcomes</strong>, while at the input of we have <strong>triggers</strong>, either internal or external. Let&rsquo;s see how to control these four elements.</p>

<h3 id="1-master-internal-triggers">1. Master internal triggers</h3>
<p>This is the most important part in my opinion, and also the most difficult. We always blame people, tools, the weather, anything for our actions, but in reality the most important triggers are inside our mind. The other causes we blame instead of ourselves are called <em>proximate causes</em>, as they help us deflect the responsibility to someone/something else.</p>
<p>The reality is that humans do not get distracted to follow pleasure (social media, food, drugs and so on), but to <strong>escape</strong> discomfort.</p>
<p>For example, when I&rsquo;m bored I try to avoid it by going on YouTube, or by eating. When I&rsquo;m writing (right now!) I try to do anything else rather than staying  calm and <em>thinking</em> about what I should write. The ones I described are just superficial issues, but there can be more serious ones (depression, going through a difficult period with our family or work, etc..).</p>
<p>Mastering our internal triggers means understanding and knowing the root causes of our distraction, in order to overcome them. The book spends 6 chapters on this argument, but I think it can be reduced to these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the root cause of your distraction (hint: it&rsquo;s usually something uncomfortable you are doing or experiencing!)</li>
<li>Practice mindfulness: observe and let the negative emotionand the discomfort dissolve, without judging. Write it down and pay attention to it</li>
<li>Reimagine both the <em>task</em> (make it fun, as explained in <em><a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/atomic-habits-book/"  target="_blank" >Atomic Habits</a></em>) and <em>yourself</em> (willpower does not go away, and you can practice self-compassion when pulled away by distractions)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-make-time-for-traction">2. Make time for traction</h3>
<p>Traction is given by the actions that draw us to what we want in our life, our <em>values</em>. Distraction is instead when we are pulled away from our goals. There&rsquo;s a catch: how can we say we’re distracted without knowing from <em>what</em> we are pulled away from, what are our goals?</p>
<p><strong>Knowing our values</strong> and goals is the first step in gaining traction.</p>
<p>The second step is to actually <strong>make time for it</strong>, with time-boxing. It&rsquo;s simple (at least that’s how Nir explains it): take a calendar and fill the white spaces with what you want to do… This includes also actions we would think of as distractions! Remember: if I planned to watch an anime or to daydream at work, it’s expected 😇.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like the idea of planning every moment in my life, and it&rsquo;s  a very difficult thing to do. Anyway, this surely helps fighting distraction better than long-revisited todo lists.</p>
<p>Values and actions can be put in three categories: “<em>You</em>”, ”<em>Relationships</em>” and “<em>Work</em>” (which also includes other things that are not work, such as studying</p>
<p>The first time to schedule is “<strong>You</strong>” time. This means time for sleeping, get healthy and  also mundane things like cleaning yourself 😃. Remember that planning and actually taking the time is the important thing. You do not control the outcomes of your actions, only the inputs. For example, if you want to write or learn something, start by showing up and starting, then the outcome will either come or not by itself, and not entirely in your control.</p>
<p>After planning “You” time, it&rsquo;s important to give time to <strong>relationships</strong>, both with friends and family, and not give them the <em>residual</em> time. It can be going out for dinner, see friends or make time for children.</p>
<p>Finally, schedule also time for <strong>work and study</strong>. Notice that work is the last priority in this plan, while in our life it’s usually the first. We work long hours and without much focus, thinking we should work even more. Instead, create a schedule (with your manager/colleagues/stakeholders) and revisit it periodically (like an agile sprint) to choose which activities have priority and require your attention. Don&rsquo;t work hard, work smart (yes, it’s a cliché, but a very useful one)</p>
<h3 id="3-hack-back-external-triggers">3. Hack back external triggers</h3>
<p>Until now we&rsquo;ve worked with with out internal triggers, and tried to regain our time and link it with our values. It&rsquo;s now time to regain that time effectively, by hacking the external triggers that draw us to distraction.</p>
<p>The book spends 9 chapters on the argument, but the most important question we need to ask ourselves every time we encounter a trigger is: “is the trigger serving us, or <em>are we serving the trigger”</em>?</p>
<p>From this we can hack <em>back</em> the triggers, making them serve us. The chapters can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defend your <strong>focus</strong>, and signal when you are busy and should not be disturbed (the book provides a paper red light to attach to your monitor to do it)</li>
<li>Reduce your time checking (and re-checking) <strong>emails</strong> by sending less emails (less people will respond), delaying your answers, timeboxing your email processing time and finally scheduling office hours to avoid long email threads</li>
<li>Use <strong>chats</strong> sparingly and selectively (be picky). Important communication should be slow!</li>
<li><strong>Meetings</strong> should be for making decisions (not problem-solving and brainstorming), should be hard to call (ask for an agenda and a brief document before) and the people involved should be present (not in “phisically present”, but mentally) and active (no devices used to “escape” or do other work!)</li>
<li>Hack back your devices
<ul>
<li>Remove distracting apps from your smartphone. Use the OS settings to reduce notifications to a minimum, schedule “Do Not Disturb” time and rearrange apps to make is more difficult to use the distracting (but needed) ones. You can also delete apps and use the web version (or use it just on the pc!)</li>
<li>Clean your desktop and disable all notifications on your pc</li>
<li>Save online articles for later and timebox your online reading time. Also, you can listen to articles while you do some less demanding task (chores, walking etc..)</li>
<li>If you really cannot stop using social media, at least stop the infinite scroll of the feed with some desktop extensions. Use social media only as a tool and not an escape</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-prevent-distraction-with-pacts">4. Prevent distraction with pacts</h3>
<p>After mastering internal and external triggers, and making time for traction, we are still missing something. The final piece of the puzzle to become indistractable is represented by <strong>pacts</strong>.</p>
<p>A pact is a pre-commitment, a choice done before doing the actual work, which helps in “staying in” the action, in staying indistractable. An example is that of <em>Ulysses</em>, who made a pact with himself and his crew to avoid falling into the Sirens trap.</p>
<p>We can make the same type of pact for our distractions!</p>
<p>A note on this: pacts should be done only after managing the previous 3 indistractable strategies: internal triggers, external triggers and time for traction. Doing it before is almost useless, because we haven&rsquo;t treated the causes of our distraction yet.</p>
<p>Example of pacts that can be done with ourselves include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effort</em> pacts: increase the difficulty of unwanted behaviours (distraction). For example, blocking social networks or asking friends for accountability</li>
<li><em>Price</em> pacts: put money on the line! If you don&rsquo;t commit, pay for it. Price pacts are scary, and should be done only in contexts where external triggers can be managed (and without beating ourselves up if we don&rsquo;t succeed)</li>
<li><em>Identity</em> pacts: identify yourself as what you want to be (e.g. <em>indistractable</em>) and act accordingly. Share your identity with others (social pressure!) and align behaviour with values and identity</li>
</ul>
<p>I find pacts to be a perfect corollary to the other strategies. They are included in my view of “design instead of fight”. If we design ourselves and our environment to follow our goals, it&rsquo;s way easier to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="have-i-become-indistractable">Have I become indistractable?</h2>
<p>I found this book extremely interesting. It is full of strategies and advice on how to fight our distraction and design an environment in which we can work and live with focus and concentration. It&rsquo;s a great companion for other similar books (”Deep Work” by Cal Newport and “Atomic Habits” by James Clear) about productivity and attention, without falling into common stereotypes.</p>
<p>In the end, I think it helped me in getting (just a little bit for now) less distractible, even if I already knew some of the strategies described. The most important thing for me is to know that most of the times, my distraction comes from within (my emotions, mood and so on) and that by finding my real goals and values I be more focused.</p>
<p>This was my short summary and comment on <em>Indistractable</em>. What do you think? Did you read it? If so, share your opinion and insights in the comments or on my social (or in private 😛).</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post.</p>
<p>I recently had to improve the documentation for a project, and collected some ideas and tools along the way, so I&rsquo;ll share here what I learned 😃.</p>
<h2 id="we-dont-talk-enough-about-documentation">We don’t talk enough about documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation is one of the most important elements of software. It allows to collect all the tribal knowledge about a product/project into a shared space. It also avoids the creation of “knowledge silos”, of “tribal knowledge” and in general allows to share the knowledge among the team members, avoiding the so called “bus factor” of a team (if a team member leaves or cannot work on the project anymore, who are going to remember all the nooks and crannies?).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, documentation is also the most dreaded task for us developers…. we hate writing it! For many developers the code should be “self-documenting”, meaning that clean abstractions and names should allow to understand the code and the product at a glance. Unfortunately, the reality is quite different: architectural choices and business decisions cannot be embedded easily in the code, and it&rsquo;s necessary to keep a separate place to document them.</p>
<p>In addition, we must not forget about <em>external</em> documentation for the interfaces that our product serves, both in terms of UI and features, and in terms of external API. In general, we owe the documentation to our team and to our users.</p>
<p>In the last months, I worked for a startup in which the product was in need of documentation. The product includes a central application, and some related SDKs to communicate with the application and a hardware device. With an incoming release date, the last thing needed was the software documentation, which until now was kept in word documents…. so I started researching for alternatives. I wanted an easy to use technology that would allow us to ship the documentation easily and without messing up with tools (word, latex, slides 🤢 or other stuff like this..). I remembered watching a talk at <a href="https://fosdem.org/"  target="_blank" >FOSDEM</a> about documentation-as-code, and delved deeper into the topic. Here is what I found.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: all the opinions expressed in this post are mine and not of my employer, and this post is not a tutorial or a guide… just me listing some tools and describing what I chose for the project!</em></p>
<h2 id="documentation-as-code">Documentation-as-Code</h2>
<p>Documentation-as-Code is a simple concept, which can be summarised as “keep and manage your documentation like your code”.</p>
<p>Basically, documentation should be treated like code, and as such should be kept near it, ideally in the same repository. This brings multiple advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easier to keep the documentation updated while the software evolves</li>
<li>Provides a centralised space to keep the documentation, without the fragmentation given by other solutions (e.g. word documents on dropbox 😏)</li>
<li>Allows to automate the documentation release along with the software (CI/CD for docs 😍)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the advantages of treating documentation as code. This methodology is also a better fit with modern software development, as it employs the same versioning and release tools we usually use to develop software.</p>
<p>Another advantage of docs-as-code is that, by keeping the documentation alongside the code, we can improve the documentation itself by generating parts of it directly from the code! This is the approach we took with the SDKs for example.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-as-code-tools">Documentation-as-Code Tools</h2>
<p>When choosing a tool to manage and generate the documentation for our project, I looked for 3 main characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) or a SSG (Static Site Generator) tool?</li>
<li>Can it generate the documentation from code comments? In particular, for our project we were targeting a C# and C++ codebase, so the tool should have supported both</li>
<li>Does it allow to export the documentation (e.g. as pdf?). This might be useful for offline browsing</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a short list of the tools I considered. First, the SaaS products:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/"  target="_blank" >GitBook</a> - Allows to manage your documentation online, with support for authorisation, public and private pages and custom domains</li>
<li><a href="https://about.readthedocs.com/"  target="_blank" >ReadTheDocs</a> - Based on sphinx, allows to host projects documentation (free for open source projects)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, some static site generators:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://retype.com/"  target="_blank" >ReType</a> - Fast and easy to use, with export to pdf features, but with paid license over a certain number of pages</li>
<li><a href="https://docusaurus.io/"  target="_blank" >Docusaurus</a> - Generates a website using MDX and React components. Beautiful, but without generation from code comments and native export to pdf features</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/"  target="_blank" >Sphinx</a> - Great tool with export features (html, latex, pdf and so on), extensible with community plugins and themes</li>
<li><a href="https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/"  target="_blank" >DocFx</a> - Generates a documentation websites from .NET Code, assemblies and XML comments. Supports only .NET/C#</li>
<li><a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/"  target="_blank" >Doxygen</a> - Old but gold! Generate documentation from code comments and markdown files. Support for a lot of languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the tools I looked for can be used create or host a website for the documentation, but only two of them (doxygen and docfx) allowed to generate most of the documentation from the code itself. Maybe this feature has gone out of fashion (code should be self-describing!! no comments!!), but I find it quite relevant, and more so if I need to document a public library distributed to customers.</p>
<h2 id="solution-with-doxygen--markdown">Solution with Doxygen + Markdown</h2>
<p>In the end, given the requirements I listed above, I chose to generate the documentation using doxygen, and to integrate it with markdown files and a nice css template.</p>
<p>Doxygen is an open source tool to generate a (pretty ugly) static website entirely from the project code, using special annotations and comments. In addition to that, it allows to add markdown pages for more prosaic documentation. I used this last feature for the user manual of the application, while the SDK documentation was mainly generated directly from the comments in the code.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage of doxygen is its “old-style” output, for which I found a great solution called “Doxygen Awesome”.</p>
<p><a href="https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/"  target="_blank" >Doxygen Awesome</a> is a custom css and javascript template which gives doxygen a more “modern” look. It has some nice features, like light/dark theme, mobile usability, code blocks with a copy button and many others. You can refer to the <a href="https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/"  target="_blank" >website</a> to see it in action, and the <a href="https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css"  target="_blank" >github repo</a> for the code.</p>
<p>The basic theme and repo was almost perfect for the project. I started adding code comments and markdown files to it and tweaking the Doxyfile for my purposes.</p>
<p>In the end I even tweaked the template code a bit. Here you can find some of the changes I made to the template (I might publish them somewhere to be reused some day…).</p>
<h3 id="video-embedding-and-dark-mode">Video embedding and dark mode</h3>
<p>The first change I made was to add a class to embed videos, as the basic template inverted all colours whenever the dark theme was toggled. This basically rendered the embedded videos in negative!</p>
<p>Very cool, but not very effective when reading documentation.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, I added this class to the doxygen-awesome css:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/* Manage responsive video */</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>While adding a video to a markdown file can be done with this snippet (which can also be added as alias to the doxyfile):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span>\htmlonly

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>\endhtmlonly
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are still issues with this approach. For example, videos can only be shown in the html output and not in others (e.g. latex/pdf). In the future I might create a command/alias to show the video or an alternate picture/thumbnail for non-interactive outputs.</p>
<h3 id="lightdark-mode-logo">Light/Dark mode logo</h3>
<p>Doxygen allows to set a logo for the project, which will be shown in the top-left/right corner of the page. This presented an issue with doxygen awesome: while the standard css shipped with doxygen-awesome inverts every component’s hue when dark mode is toggled, we wanted the logo to look good in both modes (and not just to look as a negative of the original). To do it, I just changed the content of the logo image based on the dark/light mode class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/* Manage logo in dark and light mode */</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">html</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">dark-mode</span> #projectlogo <span style="color:#f92672">img</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">content</span>: url(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;./logo_light.png&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">html</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">light-mode</span> #projectlogo <span style="color:#f92672">img</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">content</span>: url(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;./logo_dark.png&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Both logo pictures are added in the <em><strong>img</strong></em> directory and to the Doxyfile.</p>
<h3 id="content-pictures-zoom-on-click">Content Pictures zoom on click</h3>
<p>The final touch I gave to the documentation website was a modal to zoom on images when they are clicked. This allows to keep the pictures small when inside the documentation, but also to show them at full resolution when the user needs it.</p>
<p>I won’t show here the code (I basically copied code from stack overflow 😅 not a clean solution). In short: after loading the page, a js snippet looks for all pictures and adds a <em>onClick</em> to each, which shows the clicked picture in a modal window.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>That’s all!</p>
<p>In this post I showed how writing and managing documentation as code leads to a better documentation and improved processes. I also described the latest Docs-as-Code solution I found for a project and small tweaks and improvements I made to make it more effective.</p>
<p>Even if I didn’t show any of the results (you can watch a sample directly on <a href="https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/"  target="_blank" >doxygen awesome documentation</a>, no need to see my project code 😛), I hope this post inspired you to get into the world of documentation-as-code (you can find some links in the “Resources” section below and scattered inside the post).</p>
<p>Thanks, and see you next time! 👋</p>
<p>PS. If you want to see the final results, <a href="https://weart.it/docs/sdkcpp/"  target="_blank" >here</a> is the documentation for the startup&rsquo;s C++ SDK, while <a href="https://weart.it/developer-guide/"  target="_blank" >here</a> are all the other resources and documentation outputs</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Last Friday I attended the 2023 <a href="https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/"  target="_blank" >Working Software Conference</a> in Milan. The Working Software Conference is an event organised by the <a href="https://agilemovement.it"  target="_blank" >Italian Agile Movement</a>, focused on the second principle of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org"  target="_blank" >agile manifesto</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Working software over comprehensive documentation</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The meaning of this principle is that we should focus on delivering value (the working software) to the user instead of writing extensive specification documents (a.k.a. “wasting time”, as all the requirements and documentation will need to be adapted to change in a very short time).</p>
<p>The conference contained a mixture of front sessions and workshops.
In particular, I attended two workshops, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. In this post I present a small summary and comment of the two workshops, with some considerations at the end.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h3 id="affoghiamo-i-microservizi-nella-birra---christian-de-simone-and-alberto-acerbis">“Affoghiamo i microservizi nella birra” - Christian De Simone and Alberto Acerbis</h3>
<p><em>“Let’s drown microservices in beer”</em></p>
<p>The first workshop I attended was held by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aacerbis/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Acerbis</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/desimonechristian/"  target="_blank" >Christian De Simone</a>, and was about how a monolith can deliver value to the customer in a fast way, and without compromising its future extension and scalability.</p>
<p>The first part was a small exercise: we had to design and start implementing a couple of services (purchases and warehouse) for a small brewery. We divided in groups, and in my team we immediately started splitting the two domains in separate micro services communicating with an external broker. We hadn’t even started to implement the system (just coded the first purchases endpoint) that it was time for a discussion with the other teams.</p>
<p>Every team used a different approach: serverless, microservices, monolith and so on…. in the end, Alberto and Christian discussed the different pros and cons of our solutions, and then presented a way to deliver value to the customer without creating unneeded complexity and costs: a <strong>Modular Monolith</strong>.</p>
<p>Alberto showed an example <a href="https://github.com/BrewUp/WorkingSoftware-2023"  target="_blank" >solution</a>, with the two different domains implemented as projects inside the same solution. Every domain was separated from the other (and the separation checked with <a href="https://archunitnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"  target="_blank" >ArchUnit</a> tests) and communicated with a common broker implemented with the <a href="https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR"  target="_blank" >MediatR</a> library. This kind of architecture has the pros of both monolith (fast iterations for a small team and small product) and modular and event-based applications, allowing further extensibility in the future, <strong>if</strong> and when the business will grow.</p>
<p>After seeing the implementation of a modular monolith, a question remained: how do we deploy it? And how do we keep costs to a minimum doing it? Different solutions exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monolith executable deployed on a VM</li>
<li>Docker container deployed using docker compose or k8s</li>
<li>Serverless solutions such as container-as-a-service or function-as-a-service</li>
</ul>
<p>Christian showed us a possible solution: given that the first implementation of the system is a simple monolith, it’s possible to keep costs low by taking advantage of managed serverless solutions, and using docker allows to still be prepared for future extensions to the system (e.g. in a Kubernetes cluster).</p>
<p>Our task for the second half of the workshop was to “dockerize” the simple endpoint we developer earlier and push it to a GitHub repository. He then showed us a way of deploying docker containers in production, by using a managed service offered by <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-containers/"  target="_blank" >scaleway</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to show off how we could deploy to Kubernetes, in case our brewery would grow a lot!! Christian set up a small Kubernetes cluster (always on scaleway) in which to deploy our services when they were pushed on a GitHub repository. He also explained a useful tool for deploying on Kubernetes, called <a href="https://helm.sh"  target="_blank" >helm</a>, which allows to define “charts” (parametrised templates of k8s resources and deployments) that can be deployed as a single unit. Helm is useful both for our projects and to deploy external dependencies (he deployed a MongoDb instance with a click).</p>
<p>Alberto and Christian explained the Modular monolith concept in a easily understandable way, and we were able to gain some concepts and understand the pros and cons of it. In addition, the live code explanation and live deploy to Kubernetes were amazing 😃. I also discovered some tools (MediatR, ArchUnit and helm) that I didn’t know yet, and will try for sure in my projects!</p>
<h3 id="faccio-prima-il-refactor-o-i-tests---gianni-bombelli">“Faccio prima il refactor o i tests?” - Gianni Bombelli</h3>
<p><em>“Should I do refactoring or tests first?”</em></p>
<p>In the afternoon, I participated in a workshop held by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli/"  target="_blank" >Gianni Bombelli</a> and focused on testing and refactoring a (small) piece of legacy code.</p>
<p>We started the workshop with a great ice breaker: Gianni gave us a roll of toilet paper and asked each participant to draw as much paper as we usually use…. then, for each square of paper, each one had to say something about him/herself. Even before coding, I learned something 😂 to use less paper…</p>
<p>The workshop exercise was to work in pairs, testing and refactoring a small piece of code (you can find it already solved by Gianni in his <a href="https://github.com/bombo82/workshop-ws-2023"  target="_blank" >repository</a>) themed around the “Another brick in the wall” song by Pink Floyd (obviously, Gianni was wearing a “The Wall” t-shirt 😃). I paired with Christian (from the morning workshop, see above) we started to write a small test for the already implemented method we found in the repo, and….. it threw a “NotTestableCallException”!</p>
<p>Some quick notes about the exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>We couldn’t use external dependencies and libraries</li>
<li>No Mocks</li>
<li>The code worked in production, even if we encountered difficulties in testing it! So, we should have touched it with care</li>
</ul>
<p>The exception we found was a simple example of what we could find in real production code: a static method to get the logged in user (e.g. taken from spring or from .NET authentication modules), which would work when deployed but not on our local setup.</p>
<p>To continue testing this code we should have removed the exception. But how to remove it without changing the production code and without testing it first? How could we test without refactoring first, and refactor without tests?</p>
<p>Gianni solved this dilemma for us: we could leverage some minimal and automated refactoring (available in most IDEs) to “clean” the code enough to write some tests. In our case, this meant extracting the untestable method in a separate method, and extending the class under test to override the extracted method!</p>
<p>Using an overridden method in a class used only for testing is similar to mocks and stubs, but in this case the “trick” (and the smell) was quite visible (in the tested and the test classes) as a remainder for us to clean this code afterwards.</p>
<p>We used this method for most of the workshop, extracting problematic code from the tested method and using this for our purposes. In particular, we focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static/Singleton objects and methods out of our control</li>
<li>System calls (e.g. the use of DateTime.Now for equality)</li>
<li>Possibile side effects given by external dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>After covering all the code with tests, we were finally able to refactor it easily. We tried by ping-ponging refactoring pieces of code between me and Christian, and finished in no time!</p>
<p>A last issue we encountered was how to refactor a possible side effect given by the use of a DAO (Data Access Object). Gianni helped us by explaining that in these cases, the issue can be solved with an in-memory structure to mimic the underlying object without using the real dependency.</p>
<p>In the end, we finally refactored the code to our liking, and ended up the workshop with a discussion on what we had learned.</p>
<p>So, what comes first, refactoring or testing? Here&rsquo;s the solution: first, apply the minimum set of “safe” refactoring to make the code testable. Then, cover the code with tests. Only after that you can refactor the code “properly”! In most cases it will be an iterative process of refactor → test → refactor.</p>
<p>Gianni was a great instructor. He let us bang our heads against the code, and only after he showed us how to work with it. His explanations were on point and, most of all, he encouraged us to discuss with him and the other pairs. I learned some neat tricks to work with untested (and untestable) code and it was great!</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End!</h2>
<p>The Working Software Conference was a great event to meet new people and learn new technologies and ways to work as a software developer. I only attended two workshops, but I would have wanted it to go on for way more than a single day! All the instructors were prepared and engaging, and I learned a lot during the day. I hope to attend other events like this in the near future!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. Thanks, and see you next time! 👋</p>

          <p>Hi 👋  and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I’ll post a summary of a book I read at the beginning of 2023, titled “<em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>”, by <em>John Ousterhout</em>. John is a professor at Stanford, where he teaches “Operating System Principles” and “Software Design Studio”.</p>
<p>In the book he distills a career worth of advice, taken from his personal experience and the issues and solutions emerged while teaching his software design course.</p>
<p>I wrote this summary mainly for myself, to remember the concepts expressed in the book. There might be missing information and inconsistent levels of detail 😅 just a disclaimer.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<h2 id="its-all-about-complexity">It’s All About Complexity</h2>
<p>Writing Software is one of the purest creative activities done by humans. It allows to create entire systems and world only constrained by the developers’ imagination.</p>
<p>However, the greatest limitation of creating software is our ability to <em>understand</em> it. Over time, complexity will inevitably increase, so we must find ways to minimise its impact. But <strong>what</strong> is complexity, and how can we <strong>reduce</strong> it? These are the goals of the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Complexity manifests itself with symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Amplification</strong>: simple changes require to modify code in many different places</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Load</strong>: how much a developer needs to know to complete a task
(e.g. shorter but difficult to understand is worse than longer but easier to understand code)</li>
<li><strong>Unknown Unknowns</strong> (the worst): it’s not obvious which code to modify/add to complete a task</li>
</ul>
<p>But what are the causes of complexity? The book highlights two, <em>dependencies</em> and <em>obscurity</em>, which can be reduced by making code obvious and easy to read, by encapsulating the complexity in separate modules and in general by designing the system better (easy right? 😅).</p>
<h2 id="tactical-vs-strategic-programming">Tactical vs Strategic Programming</h2>
<p>To improve the quality of software, we must change out <em>mindset,</em> from <strong>tactical</strong> to <strong>strategic</strong>.</p>
<p>Tactical programming focuses only on working software. “If it works it’s ok, let’s go on the next task”. Thinking in terms of working code, and not quality and design, leads to incremental complexity in the long term. Code becomes more complex because every small complexity adds up. Refactoring is seen as a cost because it will slow down developers, so the design is never modified from the starting one.</p>
<p>Strategic programming is the solution to increasing complexity. The primary goal of strategic programming is to <em>produce a great design, which also happens to work</em>. It can be seen as an investment in the quality of software, which over time will avoid complexity and allow to ship features fast and lower development costs.</p>
<p>Some modern software trends (such as Agile and TDD) expose to the risk of tactical programming, by proposing an iterative approach and focusing on features instead of abstractions. When working in an iterative approach it is then important to focus on <strong>abstractions</strong> instead of single features/modules/methods, and outside-in design might be a possible solution (my take on the argument at least, read more <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/"  target="_blank" >here</a>).</p>
<h2 id="modular-design">Modular Design</h2>
<h3 id="deep-modules">Deep Modules</h3>
<p>The center of the book is dedicated to modular design and its main benefits. In modular design, a software system is decomposed in a set of (relatively) independent modules. The goal while designing a modular system is to minimise the dependencies between modules.</p>
<p>A dependency can be formal, based on the public <em>interface</em> of a module, or informal, based on the module’s <em>behaviour</em> and side-effects. The book advocates for <strong>deep</strong> modules, meaning modules that have a simple interface hiding powerful functionalities. This is in contrast to <strong>shallow</strong> modules, with complex interfaces and simple implementations.</p>
<p>An example of deep module is the Unix I/O api, which exposes simple methods (open, read, write, close) to manage a really complex underlying system (filesystems, buffers, disks and so on). Examples of shallow modules are instead pass-through methods, linked lists and in general all the classes we create which don’t hide the underlying implementation.</p>
<h3 id="information-hiding">Information Hiding</h3>
<p>Information hiding is the fist technique that can be used to create deep modules. It consists in encapsulating design decisions and information behind an interface which doesn’t expose it, thus hiding the underlying complexity (examples of underlying information: networking, data structures, multithreading, parsing and serialization, system and physical stuff like protocols and disks, etc..).</p>
<p>The opposite of information hiding is information leakage, in which the underlying design choices and implementation  “leak” from the interface. One of the causes of information leakage is <strong>temporal decomposition</strong>, in which the execution order of the operation is reflected in the code structure (e.g. class to read, then to modify and finally a class to write the result… they pass the underlying structure among them, leaking it outside the actual interface). The solution is actually contrary to the current best practices, which proposed to create a lot of small classes with shallow interfaces: create slightly larger classes which encapsulate more operations (still keeping levels of abstraction separated). The same thing can be done inside classes, by using information hiding and deep (private) methods to hide implementation details.</p>
<h3 id="general-purpose-modules-are-deeper">General-Purpose Modules are Deeper</h3>
<p>Another consideration is to think about <strong>general-purpose</strong> classes instead of special-purpose interfaces. A general-purpose interface is by definition deeper, as it must present a common (we hope simpler) interface to the users to deal with different cases. A special purpose interface is instead designed around the special case it is handling. The goal should be to design <em>somewhat general-purpose</em> interfaces without over-engineering the code too early (it’s an investment, but it shouldn’t block the development and risk to be useless in the future). The book proposes three questions (”What is the simplest interface for the current use?”, “In how many situations will this method be used?”, and “Is this API easy to use for my current needs?”) to discern if the class is general purpose or just over-engineered.</p>
<h3 id="different-layer-different-abstraction">Different Layer, Different Abstraction</h3>
<p>Systems are usually designed as <strong>layers</strong>, each with a different level of abstraction offered. When two adjacent layers offer similar abstractions, this is a red flag. Most of the times this leads to shallow modules, which don’t hide complexity and just bloat the system.</p>
<p>The biggest example are pass-through methods, which just call the same method of the underlying layer. This approach doesn’t hide anything and adds complexity to the system, as it adds a similar interface without adding functionality! The book proposes three solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose the lower layer directly to the higher-level modules</li>
<li>Redistribute functionality between classes</li>
<li>Merge the two layers</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, having duplicated interfaces is ok, such as in <strong>dispatcher</strong> and interfaces with multiple implementations (such as disk drivers). In most cases it is instead harmful.</p>
<p>One kind of API duplication is given by <strong>decorators</strong>. A decorator has always the same interface, but different implementations which are used to extend the functionality. This might lead to an explosion in the number of decorators, each for a single operation. This represents a case of <em>shallow</em> modules.</p>
<p>Another form of duplication is given by <strong>pass-through variables</strong>, which must be passed between multiple layers and it’s basically a leaked information. Think about configuration parameters and arguments that are used by lower level classes, but not by the higher levels. Pass-through variables add complexity because they force all the intermediate layers to be aware of their existence. The solutions for this problem are mostly ugly, so a compromise must be reached and it’s a design decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the information in a global variable</li>
<li>Use an already existing object related to the lower-level module in which to put the variable</li>
<li>Introduce a <em>context</em> object, which presents some of the disadvantages of global variables, but allows to have multiple instances in the same process and it’s more test-friendly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pull-complexity-downwards">Pull Complexity Downwards</h3>
<p>The goal of software design is to minimise complexity, thus it’s important to hide the complexity whenever it is possible. This is also valid for interfaces. It is better to make a more complex implementations, if that means a simpler interface for the users. This relates to the “investment mindset” explained at the beginning of the book.</p>
<p>The most important lessons is to avoid exposing configuration parameters as much as possible, and if necessary, to compute reasonable defaults if that’s the case.</p>
<p>Don’t take it too far however, by putting all of the code into a class or merging too many classes. Pulling down complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>should simplify the interface</li>
<li>should be done on functionality related to the existing one</li>
<li>should result in many simplifications elsewhere in the application</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="together-or-apart">Together or Apart?</h3>
<p>Deciding to merge or divide functionality is a fundamental question developers face. In general, the rule is to <strong>simplify</strong> the interfaces and to create <em><strong>deep</strong></em> modules and methods. Splitting or putting together code can help, but it’s full of compromises and choices.</p>
<p>Subdividing may increase complexity (it creates a higher <strong>number</strong> of components, additional code to manage, might lead to more dependencies and separation or duplication of cohesive functionalities. Bringing pieces of code together might help in reducing the complexity, and good indicators are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared information</li>
<li>Simpler interface when merged</li>
<li>Duplication of functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>Splitting is instead indicated when there is a mixture of general and special purpose code in the same module (it might be better to separate the two) and when the functionalities inside the module are not related. In general, a method/module should <strong>do one thing and do it completely</strong>.</p>
<p>When splitting is important to still keep modules deep, while us developers have a tendency to split too much (I’m actually torn on this, given the advice from uncle bob and countless people saying to divide in minuscule, but <strong>shallow</strong>, methods).</p>
<p>Splitting can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extracting a subtask into a separate method (keeping the methods deep, remember!)</li>
<li>Splitting in two separate methods → avoid conjoined methods, in which you cannot understand the methods/modules independently. also, avoid shallow methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge http reading and parsing method because they shared the http request informations</li>
<li>Bring together to simplify the interface (what should be done with stream and buffers in java)</li>
<li>Separate a class for logging</li>
<li>Separate text-related stuff and ui operations in the editor example (general text handling vs special operations such as selection and undo)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>Exception handling is a huge source of complexity in software systems. An exception alters the flow of the program, and must be either handled or reported to the upper layer. In addition, code that handles exceptions tends to be verbose, complex and an additional source of exceptions itself!</p>
<p>Programmers tend to throw exceptions at every suspicious behaviour, but a class with a lot of exceptions is <em><strong>shallow</strong></em> and leads to further complexity. The book list 4 ways to reduce exceptions in our code.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define errors out of existence</strong>: change the code in order to handle special cases (or avoid them) without raising exceptions</li>
<li><em>Masking</em>: detecting and handling the exception at a lower level (e.g. with retries)</li>
<li><em><strong>Aggregation:</strong></em> handle many exceptions with a single piece of code at a higher level and in a more generic way</li>
<li><strong>Crash/Abort</strong>: to be used only for exceptions for which there is no recovery (e.g. most out-of-memory and I/O errors)</li>
</ul>
<p>The same principles can be used to handle special cases, and not just errors, in our code. Defining special cases out of existence with general-purpose code, or handling special cases in separate internal methods and classes can help create deep modules, thus reducing complexity.</p>
<h2 id="commenting-code">Commenting Code</h2>
<p>Comments are the most important form of documentation that developers can write: they help improve the design (if written before writing code), reduce cognitive load and remove unknown unknowns by capturing both high and low-level details that are not present in the code.</p>
<p>However, programmers tends to not write (or delay writing) comments, with main excuses being that “code should be self-documenting” (leading to smaller methods and shallow modules), that they don’t have time (it doesn’t take much), that they have seen only worthless comments (that’s why it’s important to write them correctly) and that they require constant update (that’s because they are coupled to the implementation, and they shouldn’t).</p>
<p>In general, comments should describe the <em><strong>what</strong></em> and <strong>why</strong> of the underlying code, and not the how (implementation). They shouldn’t just repeat the code, and instead <strong>add precision</strong> or provide the underlying <strong>intuition</strong> and <strong>reasons</strong> why the code was written in the first place (e.g. design decision, fixed bug reference, adherence to protocols and standards etc..) . An example are interface comments, which allows the user of an interface to see what it does without reading the underlying code. Implementation comments describe complex details inside the code, but they should be kept <em><strong>near</strong></em> the code they describe (e.g. not at the beginning of a method or in the interface definition). <em><strong>Cross-Module</strong></em> comments should be kept in a easily discoverable place for the developer (e.g. in a common class/file, or in extreme cases in an external doc file, even if less desirable).</p>
<p>Comments can also be used as a <strong>design</strong> <strong>tool</strong>, by writing them before the code. In this way, the comments will reflect the high-level overview of the implementation, will be written better and force the developer to think about the design before coding. If comments are complex or describe the implementation in too much detail, then the final design will be complex and/or shallow.</p>
<h2 id="consistency-and-clarity">Consistency and Clarity</h2>
<p>The final advice of the book is that code should be <strong>obvious</strong>, meaning that the reader should have all the information needed to understand the code and modify it. Being obvious means having a low complexity and clear interface. This can be done by working both the design and the <em>consistency</em> of the code.</p>
<p>Regarding consistency, it can be enforced by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following conventions and enforcing a coding style (e.g. with tools such as linters and with code review)</li>
<li>Giving the right <strong>names</strong> (they must be precise, with a clear definition and purpose, and consistent in the entire codebase)</li>
<li>Documentation (both in form of <strong>comments</strong> and external documentation for conventions and overall design)</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the code shouldn’t violate the reader’s expectation, in order to work as a cognitive leverage: if the design is consistent and obvious, once the developer learns how something is done in one place, he can use that knowledge to understand other places of the codebase which use the same approach.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. It was short (just 170 pages!), but full of insights, opinions and a ton of advice!</p>
<p>Some advice contained in the book made me think about current practices. For example, short methods are a cornerstone of clean coding, but the author goes against them when they make the code “shallower”. Another controversy are the chapters on commenting code, in which the author goes against the myth of “self-documenting code”.</p>
<p>I must admit that I don’t always follow the advice given by the author (for example I don’t comment the code much, and sometimes consistency is not my first concern), but from now on I’ll watch out on many of the “red flags” contained in the book.</p>
<p>That’s it for today! I hope you enjoyed this summary. I might have skipped some concepts and chapters (e.g. the last one about “designing for performance”). I recommend this book for anyone interested in improving his development and design skills.</p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>PS. The book contains a list of “red flags” to keep in mind while writing or reviewing code. Each of the red flags might represent the symptom of design issues in the system.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shallow Module:</strong> the interface of a class or method isn’t much simpler than its implementation</li>
<li><strong>Information Leakage</strong>: a design decision is reflected in multiple modules</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Decomposition</strong>: the code structure is based on the order in which operations are executed, not on information hiding</li>
<li><strong>Overexposure</strong>: an API forces callers to be aware of rarely used features in order to use commonly used features</li>
<li><strong>Pass-Through Method</strong>: a method does almost nothing except pass its arguments to another method with a similar signature</li>
<li><strong>Repetition</strong>: a nontrivial piece of code is repeated over and over</li>
<li><strong>Special-General Mixture</strong>: special-purpose code is not cleanly separated from general-purpose code</li>
<li><strong>Conjoined Methods</strong>: two methods have so many dependencies that it’s hard to understand the implementation of one without understanding the implementation of the other</li>
<li><strong>Comment Repeats Code:</strong> all of the information in a comment is immediately
obvious from the code next to the comment</li>
<li><strong>Implementation Documentation Contaminates Interface:</strong> an interface
comment describes implementation details not needed by users of the thing
being documented</li>
<li><strong>Vague Name:</strong> the name of a variable or method is so imprecise that it doesn’t
convey much useful information</li>
<li><strong>Hard to Pick Name:</strong> it is difficult to come up with a precise and intuitive name
for an entity</li>
<li><strong>Hard to Describe:</strong> in order to be complete, the documentation for a variable or
method must be long</li>
<li><strong>Non-obvious Code:</strong> the behaviour or meaning of a piece of code cannot be
understood easily</li>
</ul>

<p>Typical developer performing a kata</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kata&rdquo; is a term borrowed from martial arts. It refers to &ldquo;a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but can also be reviewed within groups and in unison when training&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata"  target="_blank" >Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Developers have adopted this term and applied it to their set of movements, which include coding, testing, and designing. A kata is a short problem/exercise meant to be practiced many times. The same kata can be practiced with different languages, approaches, and methodologies, providing a new perspective each time to learn.</p>
<p>In Katurday sessions, the focus is on practicing one or more katas with other people, usually by doing pair or mob programming. By practicing in a group, we step out of our comfort zone (programmers aren&rsquo;t the best at socializing) and receive immediate feedback from more experienced developers, while also having fun together!</p>
<h1 id="sessions-journal">Sessions journal</h1>
<p>Here I&rsquo;ll keep an updated list of the session in which I take part, so be sure to check this page every month for a new entry (and even if I&rsquo;m the only one reading this, I&rsquo;ll keep writing it as a journal 😛).</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="first-contact-mob-programming">First contact: Mob programming</h2>
<p>In the first meetup, the main goal was to get to know each other and practice together for the first time. And the perfect opportunity to learn with others in a psychologically safe way is mob programming!</p>
<p>In mob programming, one person (the driver) writes the code on a PC while the others (the mob) discuss what to implement and how. The discussion is moderated by a navigator, who is the person actually telling the driver what to do.</p>
<p>We practiced the <a href="https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/"  target="_blank" >Roman numerals</a> kata using mob programming and test-driven development. Given that there were too many people for a structured discussion, we used a method called <em>fishbowl</em>, in which a small group is in the mob while the rest of the audience watches (already described in <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/"  target="_blank" >this post</a> about another XPUG meetup).</p>
<p>The mob members and the navigator rotate from the audience, with a set time. Basically, if anyone had something to say or discuss about the task, they “patiently” waited for their turn 😅</p>
<p>This experience was interesting, showing that a group of software developers can come up with a high-quality and tested solution without fighting (too much).</p>
<h2 id="second-session-pairing-and-tdd">Second session: Pairing and TDD</h2>
<p>On the second meetup, we stepped out of our comfort zone. The goal this time was to practice pair programming and test-driven development. Why both practices together? Well, we had already practiced TDD in the latest session, but this time it was part of the pairing exercise itself.</p>
<p>How can TDD help make pair programming better? With <strong>ping-pong</strong> programming! One developer writes a failing test (red phase of TDD). Then, the other developer makes the test pass (green phase) and can apply some refactoring while still passing tests. Finally, they create a new failing test and give it to the first developer. This “ping-pong” between the members keeps them concentrated on the task at hand and allows them to write code as if only one person wrote it.</p>
<p>We practiced the <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/587e4b656c87d3e7f4000143"  target="_blank" >prime factors kata</a> in multiple sessions, erasing the code at the end and pairing up with another person we didn&rsquo;t know. In this kind of exercise (as in any kata), the goal is not to finish it, but to try new ways to solve it and learn. Also, by changing partners every time, we are forced to get to know a new person (duh!), and sometimes even a new programming language/framework, tools, and in general a completely new environment (e.g. different keyboard layout and operating system). It&rsquo;s obvious that changing this much on every rotation doesn&rsquo;t always allow us to finish the kata, but that&rsquo;s expected.</p>
<p>In the end, we did two pairing sessions and a final feedback session in which we shared our views on ping-pong pairing and TDD in general. It was useful to see that other people had the same ideas and concerns as me, and also different ideas about the exercise.</p>
<h2 id="third-session-refactoring">Third session: Refactoring</h2>
<p>In this session, we tackled a difficult task: refactoring a piece of code that was intentionally made unreadable, the <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata"  target="_blank" >tennis refactoring kata</a> by Emily Bache. The repository contains the same kata implemented (with lots of code smells) in most of the mainstream programming languages. For each project, it also contains a comprehensive test suite, making it perfect for practicing refactoring without worrying about the tests.</p>
<p>As in every other Katurday session, we worked in pairs and had a set time to finish. We started by choosing a language and then identified code smells, solving them by refactoring the code. In reality, my partner and I just started saying &ldquo;wow, that code sucks&rdquo; for every piece of code in the project and tried to refactor it with our gut feeling. The result came out nicely, but we didn&rsquo;t apply the rules to the letter. Nonetheless, it was still a learning experience, seeing how a comprehensive test suite helps to refactor without fear (which I cannot say about the projects I usually work on 😅).</p>
<p>One interesting technique we used was loop unrolling (example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQjUKQxFXuE"  target="_blank" >here</a>) to refactor a useless and complex loop. I had already encountered it in university to improve performance (and used it in unconventional ways for FPGA synthesis), but I never thought of it as a refactoring technique 😃.</p>
<p>After making our way through the refactoring, every pair shared their experience. It was useful to see many different approaches to the problem: top-down like ours (extracting and simplifying unrelated and big parts of the code) and bottom-up (refactoring a small but common part of the code at a time).</p>
<p>Finally, given the small amount of time remaining, we decided not to proceed with another pair/mob session, but instead watched <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAfrrkABbUvjAiZv3U8jyjDXz1fq-gu6jBA&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BwlZNIMK2RViUFptWfbZVKA%3D%3D"  target="_blank" >Gianni</a> refactor a fizzbuzz exercise in Kotlin to make it more generic and expandable 🤩 a great live refactoring lesson.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-session-object-calisthenics">Fourth session: Object Calisthenics</h2>
<p>After learning about TDD, pairing and refactoring, it was time to put it all together, by practicing <em>Object Calisthenics</em>.</p>
<p>Object Calisthenics is a set of (very strict) rules designed to &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; our code muscle. In particular, the rules are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only one level of indentation per method</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use the ELSE keyword</li>
<li>Wrap all primitives and strings (wrap primitive types in classes)</li>
<li>First-class collections (wrap collections in classes)</li>
<li>One dot per line</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t abbreviate</li>
<li>Keep all entities small</li>
<li>No classes with more than two instance variables</li>
<li>No getters/setters/properties</li>
<li>All classes must have state</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules help to effectively design code in a clean way, the same way real calisthenics helps to improve our strength without strange techniques and machines.</p>
<p>To practice Object Calisthenics we performed the <a href="https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/"  target="_blank" >bowling kata</a>, in which you have to compute the score of a bowling game given the throws results.
The kata seems simple at a first view, but has a nasty responsibility separation issue, as the bonus points of a frame depends on the next throws!</p>
<p>The rules were pretty frustrating when I started applying them! For example, not being able to nest the code too much meant I had to continually extract methods.
Another challenge was to always give state  to objects (so avoiding value objects).</p>
<p>Fortunately we started applying TDD from the beginning, so it was pretty easy to refactor the code while we added test cases. A challenge I always face when doing TDD is the level at which to begin: from the outside (big comprehensive tests that stay red for some time) or from the inside (smaller components and tests which are integrated later). I tend to create big tests but I also try to solve them immediately, which brings to not follow the &ldquo;little steps&rdquo; rule of TDD 😅.</p>
<p>In general, this katurday was really interesting, showing some &ldquo;strict&rdquo; rules that we should instead always apply to our code to make it clean and properly designed.</p>
<h2 id="thats-all">That&rsquo;s all!</h2>

          <p>Hi 👋 welcome!</p>
<p>This post is a short summary (with personal notes and opinions here and there) of the XPUGBg (Bergamo’s eXtreme Programming User Group) meetup I attended in March.</p>
<p>Actually, it’s just a bunch of notes and ideas connected together by my imagination and opinions 😂 (as I already did <a href="http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/"  target="_blank" >here</a> and <a href="http://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-jan-xp-codebase-meetup/"  target="_blank" >here</a>).</p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s talk was titled “<em>The Actor Model and why an XP programmer should know it</em>” by Emanuele DelBono.</p>
<p>Emanuele is a Software Architect and Developer at <a href="https://codiceplastico.com/"  target="_blank" >Codice Plastico</a>, a software house near Brescia. He has a lot of experience and he’s always interested in experimenting with new paradigms and technologies, and right now he’s working with Elixir (the language he used during the talk).</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<h2 id="the-actor-model">The Actor Model</h2>
<p>The Actor Model is a programming paradigm for concurrent and parallel computations. In this model, all computation is divided into different components called Actors.</p>
<p>An <strong>Actor</strong> is an individual unit of computation with its private state. A single actor by itself cannot do much but must work in a system of multiple, <strong>independent</strong> actors.</p>
<p>Multiple actors together can be used to perform any computation, but only if they communicate! This is done by assigning a unique <strong>address</strong> to each one and using messages. Each actor can receive and send messages from/to others.</p>
<p>One key difference between the Actor Model and any other event/message-based system is that an actor can process only <strong>one message at a time</strong>. This is a big constraint imposed by the model, but it makes the actor’s computation model simple to reason about. By processing one message at a time, it basically eliminates any chance of data race inside the single unit. In addition, it makes the code easily testable (send a message and check the output message and created actors; that’s it!).</p>
<p>The final action that an actor can do, apart from receiving and sending messages, is to create other actors.</p>
<p>The model just described is really similar to standard OOP. In fact, it fits perfectly with the definition given by Alan Kay, which is of multiple independent objects communicating with messages.</p>
<h3 id="pros-cons-and-use-cases">Pros, Cons, and Use Cases</h3>
<p>So, how can this paradigm be useful to us developers?</p>
<p>The first advantage of the Actor Model is the strong <strong>decoupling</strong> and <strong>isolation</strong> of state between different Actors. The Actors can only communicate using messages, so no one can access an Actor’s individual state.</p>
<p>Another pro of Actors is their extreme scalability. Depending on the Actor’s granularity (the size of each actor), there might be hundreds or even thousands of Actors at the same time in the system. Being decoupled and isolated among themselves, it’s possible to distribute the computation and the state among multiple nodes easily. This is also helped by frameworks, which handle the redistribution of Actors in the cluster automatically.</p>
<p>Finally, the model helps in reducing the cognitive load of the developer. By processing only one message at a time and communicating only through messages, the developer doesn’t need to think about nasty side effects or multi-object state changes. There might be a steeper learning curve at the beginning, as always when creating distributed systems, but the model helps in making it easier in the long run.</p>
<h3 id="actor-model-implementations">Actor Model Implementations</h3>
<p>After describing the actor model in theory, Emanuele showed us different languages that implement this paradigm. Some of the technologies are Erlang, Elixir, Akka (a framework used in the JVM and .NET ecosystems), Swift, and Pony.</p>
<p>One of the first languages to use a similar paradigm to the Actor Model is Erlang. Erlang was created in the 90s at Ericsson, and at the beginning, it was used to manage their telecommunications infrastructure (telephone switches). The main requirements it served were to allow concurrent computation, allow hot-reloading of components, and robust failure management.</p>
<p>Erlang supports all these scenarios by implementing a paradigm very similar to the Actor Model. The only differences are in the messaging order (incoming messages are ordered, while the Actor Model doesn’t require it) and the absence of exception management.</p>
<p>This last characteristic is known as “let it fail”: when an actor has an error, we don’t throw an exception, but we just let it crash and create a new one. The mechanism is a precursor to the current cloud paradigm, in which small individual components can crash and be recreated immediately (think of k8s and docker containers).</p>
<p>Elixir is the successor of Erlang, as it runs on the same virtual machine (BEAM), implements the actor model in the Erlang way, and is also functional. Emanuele used it for the demo.</p>
<h3 id="demo-pizza-ordering-api-with-actors">Demo: Pizza ordering API with Actors</h3>
<p>Emanuele used Elixir to show us a small demo of an actor-based web service for a pizza delivery service.</p>
<p>The service was pretty simple, with a web API for managing the basket, time slots, and orders from the customer and the pizzeria sides.</p>
<p>Some considerations about the demo and the model in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elixir is functional, so the internal actor state is managed with immutable and pure functions (similar to reducers)</li>
<li>We can create a lot of actors!! The demo created an actor for each user (for the basket), for each time slot (and there can be thousands of them in a year) and for each created order. They almost felt as standard objects, but all kept at runtime</li>
<li>Some actors (like the ones managing the basket) didn’t save the state in persistent storage. This was an architectural choice made based on the use case (if a basket actor fails, we just lose the current basket, nothing special)</li>
<li>Elixir allows both synchronous and asynchronous sending of messages and to respond to messages (e.g., to return errors to clients in the http endpoints)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>The meetup was really interesting. I already knew about the Actor Model (I studied a bit of Scala while in university), but this talk was a refresher on the concepts and actually showed a production-like example of how working with Actors feels.</p>
<p>I think the Actor Model paved the way for current technologies (microservices and containers) and that its philosophy is hidden in many current languages, so it’s an important paradigm to study. Also, it’s a great way to learn to divide a system into decoupled components, which fits well with other architectural practices (Domain-Driven Design, Event Sourcing, CQRS, and many other buzzwords) and with good software in general.</p>
<p>That’s it for today. I hope my short summary of Emanuele’s talk intrigued you, and that right now you’ll go watch his other talk (link right below here) and start learning the Actor Model!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋  and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I’m publishing the (raw) notes I took while reading “Atomic Habits: <em>An Easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones”,</em> by James Clear.</p>
<p>Even though I read this book two years ago, I stumbled across this notes and they were helpful in remembering its main ideas and  concepts. I know there are many summaries and reviews of this book. Still, I&rsquo;ll keep this notes on the blog as a personal learning reference.</p>
<p>If you want to see how I personally understood the concepts explained in the book, keep reading, and enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In the introduction, James writes about his teen accident with baseball and his recovery. He then talks about his college years, in which he experimented with his habits to improve, learn and become a better person and how that brought to him writing his blog and the book.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The first thing to learn about habits is that the are the <strong>compound</strong> <strong>interest of personal improvement</strong>. By harnessing small habits and improving by 1% every day, one can make exponential progress in the long term.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree entirely with the expression &ldquo;1% better every day&rdquo; because in the long run i think that improvement decreases as one become better at something. We first start by improving a lot, but with time progress becomes exponentially more difficult. Still, the advice to improve by a bit every day it’s still valid.</p>
<p>Another reminder of this chapter is that also bad habits follow the same principle: getting a little bit worse everyday means getting <strong>a lot worse</strong> in the long run.</p>
<p>To close the first chapter, the author recommends to think about <strong>systems</strong> instead of <strong>goals</strong>, because goals are not sustainable in the long period. Also, a system is more methodic and doesn&rsquo;t change once you reach a goal.</p>
<p>The second chapter talks about reverting the way in which we set habits, from <strong>outcome-based</strong> to <strong>identity-based</strong>.</p>
<p>When thinking through outcomes, each habit serves a single goal, and after that is reached we face a sense of void and don&rsquo;t continue with the habit anymore. This happened to me while at university, as I made the habit of studying just for the exams and not for the long term goal of remembering the concepts studied.</p>
<p>James advocates instead for an internal change to drive habit-forming (identity → process → outcomes). By <em><strong>identifying</strong></em> with the new person one wants to become, it&rsquo;s easier to create and stick to habits. For example, I made the choice to <em>become</em> a healthier person, so I decided to start working out during the week and eating better. If the only goal was only to lose a certain amount of weight, I don&rsquo;t think I would have stuck to it for a long time.</p>
<p>The third chapter finally gives an high level overview on how to build better habits. Each habit (good or bad) follows the <strong>cue → craving → response → reward</strong> step. Following this steps it&rsquo;s possible to create good habits and eliminate bad ones. James then lists the four laws of behavioural change, which he will explain throughout the book. To create a good habit, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make it obvious</li>
<li>Make it attractive</li>
<li>Make it easy</li>
<li>Make it satisfying</li>
</ol>
<p>To remove bad habit, you should follow the same steps, but reversed, so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make it invisible</li>
<li>Make it unattractive</li>
<li>Make if difficult</li>
<li>Make it unsatisfying</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="first-law-make-it-obvious">First Law: Make it obvious</h2>
<p>The first law is about creating the right environment and the right <strong>clues</strong> to attach to the habits you want to make. In particular, the first thing to do is to increase your <strong>awareness</strong> and list the different habits  that you have (both good and bad ones) → Habits Scorecard. The scorecard allows you to be more aware of your behaviours, in order to keep or change them after.</p>
<p>After rising the awareness on the behaviours to change or add, it&rsquo;s time to make a plan! Without a simple direction on the new habit, it&rsquo;s way more difficult to stick to it. The second technique discussed related to the first law is <strong>implementation intentions</strong> → &ldquo;I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]&rdquo;. In addition to this, you can use <strong>habit stacking</strong>, which means identifying an existing habit you already have and attach the new habit to that (&ldquo;After I [current habit], I will [new habit]). These two methods create obvious <strong>cues</strong> for the new habit, and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.</p>
<p>After taking care of which habits to create/keep and how to plan them, it&rsquo;s time to make the cues <strong>obvious</strong>. For this, the most important factor is the environment. The author says &ldquo;Behaviour is a function of the Person in their environment&rdquo;, and this means that motivation is not enough, and most of the times is irrelevant. Architecting the right environment is then the best way to boost our habit progress. The book shows some examples, I&rsquo;ll show some which I personally use:</p>
<ul>
<li>I put a book right next to my bed to read before sleeping</li>
<li>I have my pills in the kitchen, so that I remember to take them at breakfast and dinner every day</li>
<li>I create a new journal page (on notion) for the next day in the evening and keep it open in the app, so that whenever I open it I remember to journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The same thing can be applied to our digital environment. For example, moving some apps on the first screen, and apps we still need to keep but don&rsquo;t want to use in other screens. In this way, we encourage useful apps for our habits (e.g. I keep podcasts, medium and notion on my home screen, and hide all video and social apps in a subfolder in the other screen on my phone). This also work with notifications (disabling unwanted notifications and so on).</p>
<p>The final summary of this law is explained in chapter 7. We&rsquo;ve all been said that we lack self control and need more discipline, but the fact is, we need to <strong>design</strong> our environment and behaviour to not need self-control! <strong>Resisting temptations is an ineffective strategy</strong> in the long term. To remove bad habits we need then to reduce exposure to the cue that cause them (good habit → make it obvious, bad habit → <strong>make it invisible</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="second-law-make-it-attractive">Second Law: Make it attractive</h2>
<p>The second law of behaviour change is <em>make it attractive</em>. We should make our good habits tempting, &ldquo;inviting&rdquo; with different strategies. Habits are a <em>dopamine-driven feedback loop</em>, meaning that we usually have different dopamine levels (dopamine isn&rsquo;t the only factor, but it&rsquo;s used to give an idea) in different habit phases (remember cue, craving, response and reward).</p>
<p>At first, dopamine is high only after the reward. While creating a habit (and always after that) dopamine tends to rise in <em>anticipation</em> of the reward (craving), then becomes lower during the response phase (if we don&rsquo;t receive the reward later) and it should rise at the reward phase.</p>
<p>We can use this insight to make a habit attractive, by using <em><strong>temptation bundling</strong></em> (basically, stacking a habit together with another more attractive habit/activity used as a reward). It can also be used with habit stacking to make a powerful strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>After [current habit], I will [habit I need] → stacking</li>
<li>After [habit I need], I will [habit I want]  → temptation bundling</li>
</ol>
<p>it relies on transitiveness to associate the habit I need with what I want to do after, and relates it to the initial cue/habit.</p>
<p>Another way to make a habit more attractive is to use social pressure and imitation, which are innate in our instincts. We tend to imitate 3 groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>close</strong> → Surround yourself with people/culture where the behaviour you desire is the normal behaviour, and with which you already have something in common</li>
<li>The <strong>many</strong> → We tend to follow the herd, so when changing habits means going against the group, the habit will be unattractive, while it will be attractive if it means fitting in the group</li>
<li>The <strong>powerful</strong> → We imitate people we envy and see as powerful/better, so try to get approval and praise for your habit and it will be more attractive</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we associate emotions and feeling to our habits. They are the way in which our brain processes cues, and we can leverage them to control our habits. In particular, we can associate good feelings and emotions, or reduce bad emotions, associated with a good habit we want to continue, or associate bad emotions and drawbacks to bad habits we want to stop. The book does the example of changing &ldquo;have to&rdquo; with &ldquo;get to&rdquo; to make a positive impact on habits we want to take. Some personal examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <em>get to</em> walk and listen to programming podcasts</li>
<li>I <em>get to</em> practice guitar</li>
<li>I <em>get to</em> write about what I read and learn</li>
<li>I <em>get to</em> journal about my day</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same way, I could say &ldquo;I walk in the morning to get healthier and get more energy for the day&rdquo;, &ldquo;I get to write about what I read so that I can learn and grow&rdquo; etc..</p>
<h2 id="third-law-make-it-easy">Third Law: Make it easy</h2>
<p>The third law is <em>make it easy</em>. It means to reduce friction, imagine the minimum action needed to start the habit, and automate optimising choices to make the habit really easy to follow (or really difficult if that&rsquo;s the case).</p>
<p>The first concept to understand is that of “<em>preparation</em> vs <em>action”</em>: preparing is useful, but can become just another form of procrastination. It feels like progress but it isn&rsquo;t. So, preparation needs to be kept at a minimum. The important thing is to act and repeat the habit, as getting the reps is the only way to make it stick (habits form based on <strong>frequency</strong>, not time!) → How many, not how long</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the <em>effort</em>, the energy spent on the habit. Humans act based on the <em>law of least effort. W</em>e will naturally follow the option which leads to the least amount of effort required. This can be used to our advantage in our habit making process, as we can change the environment to reduce the friction associated with a habit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting workout clothes in the most visible or the most useful place</li>
<li>Preparing healthy food ahead of time to have it ready when needed</li>
<li>Placing the object required to perform the habit on the table/desk, readily accessible</li>
</ul>
<p>I do the last thing (placing a book near my bed) to give my brain the right clue, and to make it easy to do (just grab the book and read it!).</p>
<p>Another technique is the <strong>two-minutes rule</strong>. There are a handful of <em>decisive moments</em> which decide what impact we&rsquo;ll deliver in a given day. In these moments we take decisions on what to do next, and we can leverage these to improve in our habit process. The two-minute rule says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the habits takes more, reduce the effort to the minimum viable action (e.g. exercise → put on workout clothes, writing → write one paragraph/sentence). This allows to master the act of <strong>showing up</strong>. After doing the first action, we can decide to continue or not, and it&rsquo;s difficult that we&rsquo;ll stop there&hellip;</p>
<p>Finally, we have <strong>automation</strong>. I&rsquo;m a big fan of automation, because that&rsquo;s what I do for a living as a software engineer. Automation is an example of <em>commitment device</em>, which is a choice made in the present which controls our actions in the future. There are a lot of one time actions which will lock in new habits (detailed in the book, e.g. buying a good mattress, reducing mails and notifications, changing environment, reduce some automatic expenses and so on). Finally, technology can come to our aid in automating stuff (e.g. automatic telematic prescriptions, automatic wage reduction for retirement, meal-delivery services, website blockers).</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the 3rd law can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce friction by defining the least-effort action for each habit</li>
<li>Tune the environment to make future actions easier</li>
<li>Automate and make good one-time decisions to boost or block habits</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fourth-law-make-it-satisfying">Fourth Law: Make it satisfying</h2>
<p>The fourth rule is <em>make it satisfying</em>.</p>
<p>Humans have developed a lot of stuff in the last millennia. Think about breeding, farming, machines and the latest technology. Most of this developments brought a us new concept, unknown to our primate brain: that of <em>delayed reward</em>. We experience delayed reward while waiting for crops to harvest to animals growing, and in the latest 500 years we added a lot of delayed rewards of any kind.</p>
<p>However, our brain still rely on <em>instant gratification</em> to work, and we need to leverage that hardwired path in our brain, or we won&rsquo;t stick to a habit. We evaluate rewards differently through time (<em><strong>now</strong></em> is better than later).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is immediately rewarded gets repeated, and what is immediately punished is avoided.</p></blockquote>
<p>The final step to stick to a habit is then to <em>feel successful</em> after doing it. In fact, the first three laws (obvious, attractive and easy) allow us to start the new habit, while this last law allows us to repeat and stick to it!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, these are the tactics to use to obey the 4th law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reward or punish the habit <strong>immediately after</strong> the behaviour</li>
<li><strong>Track</strong> the habit (it&rsquo;s obvious, satisfying and attractive, and can be used together with habit stacking and automation!). Also, <strong>never miss twice</strong></li>
<li>Create a <strong>habit contract</strong> and find an <strong>accountability partner</strong> (make it <em><strong>unsatisfying</strong></em>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-tactics">Advanced tactics</h2>
<p>Also called &ldquo;three random chapters which did not fit in the rest of the book&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="exploration-vs-exploitation">Exploration vs Exploitation</h3>
<p>The first &ldquo;secret&rdquo; to maximise your chances of success is to choose the right field of competition, to find a game in which the odds are in your favour. Everyone keeps saying that genetics don&rsquo;t matter, and they are right. However, they define your <em>areas of opportunity</em>.</p>
<p>In short, you should create habits aligned with your ambition and your personality, as in this way it will be easier to reach a state of <em>flow</em>.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that even when you don&rsquo;t have mastery over a single thing, you can <em>specialise</em> in multiple contexts and overcome the &ldquo;accident&rdquo; of bad genetics.</p>
<p>Questions to ask yourself to find a niche in which you can gain much more with a habit:</p>
<ul>
<li>What feels like fun to me, but work to others? → not passion, but handling the <strong>pain</strong> of a task/habit</li>
<li>What makes me lose track of time? → <strong>Flow state</strong></li>
<li>Where do I get greater returns than the average person?</li>
<li>What comes naturally to me?</li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR; Work hard on things that come easy (<em><strong>exploit</strong>)</em>, and <em><strong>explore</strong></em> new opportunities sometimes.</p>
<h3 id="flow">Flow</h3>
<p>Regarding flow, the author explains what is called the &ldquo;Goldilocks Rule&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans experience peak motivation when they work on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neither too difficult (otherwise you&rsquo;ll quit) nor too easy (or you end up in boredom and quit too).</p>
<p>The road to mastery is full of boring moments, but you can try to create manageable challenges to grow without complacency, without making life too difficult to quit the habit. Keeping the repetition even when bored is the difference between amateur and professional!</p>
<p>I actually experience this rule in my life: when I play guitar (amateur level) I usually get bored and stop playing for long periods of time. Instead, I keep pushing while programming for work because it is my profession, and this gives me an edge over others who just try to do it without enduring it.</p>
<h3 id="review-and-feedback">Review and Feedback</h3>
<p>The last &ldquo;advanced tactics&rdquo; chapter is about review and feedback about your habits. The entire book covered creating, starting and keeping a habit. However, once a habit is fully formed our performance might decrease (a bit or much more) as we reach a plateau and don&rsquo;t improve upon it, letting small errors appear. This is ok for trivial habits, but not so much for important stuff (think getting healthy, learning and in general mastering a field).</p>
<p>We need to <strong>reflect</strong> and <strong>review</strong> to enable long-term improvements of our habits. Some techniques include <em>decision journals</em> and  <em>annual review + integrity report.</em></p>
<p>A final bit of advice is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are, and not identifying in the particular habits and things you do. A better way is to redefine yourself in a way which keeps important aspects of your identity even if your role and actions change, e.g:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m an athlete → I&rsquo;m the type of person who&rsquo;s mentally tough and loves a physical challenge</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m the CEO → I&rsquo;m the type of person who builds and creates things</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The hard and stiff will be broken, the soft and supple will prevail&rdquo; cit. Lao Tzu</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p><strong><strong>Atomic Habits</strong></strong> does a great job in explaining how to create and keep small habits, and why it is so important to do this. The secret to obtain results is to never stop making improvements.</p>
<p>The book was a great inspiration in how to improve through the power of habits. I really liked the part about changing the environment and automating decisions to reduce my reliance on discipline alone. I also try to make use of the book’s advice to create good habits, while I’m definitely less successful when it comes to removing bad habits 😅.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this summary/notes post 🎉, see you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post.</p>
<p>Today I just want to share some comments about my trip to FOSDEM 2023. This blog is starting to look like a travel blog for meetups and conferences 😅… I promise I’ll post some programming (practical and not) content soon.</p>
<p>As I already said in my <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/"  target="_blank" >2022 review</a>, one of my goals for 2023 is to attend more conferences and participate more in communities. I must say, I started the year in the right way 🤩.</p>
<p>I decided to go to FOSDEM in December while talking to some people at the XPUG meetup. After hearing what the event was about, I immediately grabbed a friend and bought the plane tickets to go there!</p>
<p>What is FOSDEM? It’s a free event where developers meet to share ideas and collaborate on open-source software. The event is held every year at the <a href="https://www.ulb.be/en"  target="_blank" >Université Libre de Bruxelles</a>, and is <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/about/sponsors/"  target="_blank" >sponsored</a> by the main open-source projects and companies.</p>
<p>FOSS stands for “Free and Open Source Software”: free as in both “free beer” and “free speech”. For software to be FOSS, it should give:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom to run it</li>
<li>Freedom to access his source code, study it and change it to fit our own necessities</li>
<li>Freedom to share/spread the software (original or modified) to help others</li>
</ul>
<p>Working and using open source software means collaborating with other developers, sharing our programming and product ideas, and together improving the world. And that’s exactly the spirit I saw at FOSDEM!</p>
<h2 id="community-and-inspiration">Community and Inspiration</h2>
<p>I think that being part of a community is great. It gives me a chance to see developers like me, but also completely diverse people.</p>
<p>While at FOSDEM, I experienced this sense of community and diversity firsthand. It felt like being in a sort of “tribe” of nerds/developers gathering for what they love.</p>
<p>The halls of Brussels university were full for both days of the conference. The city itself was conquered by nerds for the entire weekend! During the conference everyone was chatting about their latest projects and ideas.</p>
<p>Also, many open source projects and companies I know (think of the major Linux distros and software companies) were there with their stands, gadgets (Debian was giving away beer!) and stickers!</p>
<p>Being there reminded me of my days at university (not so long ago), hacking silly stuff on my laptop. But in this case, the people speaking and attending the conference were anything but amateurs like me 😅. Open Source can be a way to express ourselves,  to find inspiration and to be part of something bigger, and FOSDEM showed me the way many people are doing it.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-talks-i-attended">List of Talks I attended</h2>
<p>Below you can find the list of talks I personally attended while there. I didn’t attend all the events I wanted (some rooms were full all the time!) and ended up going around the different rooms in search of inspiration.</p>

<p>For him, it all comes down to optimising the work flow by accepting continuous change. In order to be more productive it’s important to reduce the work in progress, make small changes and reduce the feedback loop.</p>
<p>Regarding feedback, agile practices tend to work at the highest levels, that of release, iteration, acceptance and so on (as in the above picture). But what about the lower levels of feedback, down to the codebase itself? How do you “accelerate” the feedback loop on all levels, from code to release?</p>
<p>In the talk, Alessio explains why doing trunk-based devlopment brings the best collaboration on the codebase, by improving the feedback loop, making WIP evident and allowing to ship faster and with  higher quality.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-trunk-based-development">What is trunk-based development?</h2>
<p>Trunk-based development is a practice in which developers collaborate on the codebase in a single branch (the main/master/trunk). Instead of opening a feature branch and then do a pull/merge request to master (with the corresponding code review I hope), the developer commits directly to the main branch.</p>
<p>Trunk-based development goes hand in hand with <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"  target="_blank" >continuous integration</a> and <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html"  target="_blank" >continuous delivery</a>. In fact, by committing to the main branch and keeping it always <strong>releasable</strong>, it’s possible to deliver value to the business continuously.</p>
<p>There are variations to trunk-based development. A notable one is <strong>scaled</strong> trunk-based, used when the team size increases. In scaled trunk-based development, the developers work with <strong>short-lived</strong> (less than 1 day) feature branches. The same practices (pair programming, TDD and XP in general) are still valid, together with the constraint to keep the main branch always releasable and deployable at any time.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-trunk-based-development">Advantages of trunk-based development</h2>
<p>In the talk, Alessio highlighted the <strong>impact</strong> that trunk-based development has on the codebase and on the team/business itself.</p>
<p>The first “advantage” is that it allows to have <strong>frequent integration</strong> (better yet, <strong>continuous</strong>) of all the changes in the codebase. In this way, conflicts that arise during development are immediately identified (and corrected), without waiting until the code is reviewed in a pull request.</p>
<p>By making all changes on the same branch (main), there is a unique source of truth. As every change is immediately integrated and tested, the codebase is always updated, and there’s no conflict over which version of the code is the correct one (the answer is: the one on the main branch!).</p>
<p>Given that the team is working on the same branch, everyone can see all the current work in progress. In addition, by not using long feature branches, and being forced to integrate with main frequently, it’s more difficult to keep multiple features in progress.</p>
<p>The possibility to make small, deliverable changes forces us to <strong>refactor</strong> into small steps, and not create too many changes and conflicts. Also, by doing this with a continuous review (e.g. by pairing), we have the freedom to refactor into small steps with confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, trunk-based increase the <strong>collaboration</strong> between team members. If what I’m working on at the moment conflicts with another developer, I’m more eager to work together to merge it, and this is done (again) immediately, and not at merge time.</p>
<h2 id="a-change-of-mentality">A change of mentality</h2>
<p>To work with trunk-based development properly, we need to embrace a (sometimes radical) change of mentality. The change reflects both in social and technical practices.</p>
<p>From the social side, trunk-based development requires:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>, as everyone is working on the same codebase at the same time</li>
<li>Constructive and frequent <strong>feedback</strong>, and being open to it</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>, in the team members and in the code itself. This can be helped with XP practices such as TDD and pairing</li>
</ul>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the most important practices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small</strong>, incremental changes (in contrast to big, breaking changes and long parallel branches)</li>
<li>Attention to <strong>quality</strong> (because the main branch must always be releasable, and every commit we push could be directly deployed in production!)</li>
<li>Separation between <strong>build, deploy and release</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A strong rule is that the code should always be deployable! This is the basis for frequent releases, which allows getting faster feedback from the business and the customers.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-deploy-while-the-work-is-in-progress">How to deploy while the work is in progress?</h4>
<p>While talking about technical practices and their impact, Alessio explained how keeping build, release and deploy separate is fundamental to a collaborative codebase. But how do we keep the code “deployable” even while we are currently implementing new features?</p>
<p>The first way is to do <strong>dark launching:</strong> release the new feature, but without exposing the new/changed API (or expose it only to a subset of users, e.g. developers and internal users).</p>
<p>A second way is to use <strong>branch by abstraction</strong>: put the current api under an abstraction layer, then start to implement the new functionality in another compatible class/module. While implementing the new feature, migrate the old feature clients to the new (compatible, remember!) one, and finally remove the old module. All of this should keep the system working even when the feature is not finished yet.</p>
<p>The last way to not release in-progress work is to put the new feature behind feature toggles/flags. The toggles can be static or dynamic, but they should be short-lived (if used while developing and not for mere configuration) and removed when the feature has been released and is stable. Feature flags are also a way to decouple deploy and release of the features. In addition, they make WIP evident (as any feature toggle of that type represents a work-in-progress feature).</p>
<h2 id="considerationsdiscussions">Considerations/Discussions</h2>
<p>The characteristic I like the most in meetups is the discussion with all the participants. Alessio encouraged the audience to ask questions and express their opinions, and here are some considerations of what came out of the discussion after the talk.</p>
<p>The first thing to take care of before and while doing trunk-based development is that of <strong>ownership</strong>: who is the owner of the code? Trunk-based development works best with <strong>cohesive</strong> teams working on a <strong>product</strong>, as the code is owned by the entire team (which makes the decisions). If the code is not owned by the developer, as in some consultancy projects or in open source, then it might be better to work with other branching models (such as feature-based, git flow or github flow).</p>
<p>Another consideration is that of software <strong>versioning</strong>. Trunk-based development expects a continuous integration of the code, and this means that there is only one version of the code (the current one). If the product needs multiple versions, and separate maintenance of the versions (e.g. because some customers don’t want to pay for the newer version, but still expect bugfixes on the version they own), then there should be release branches in addition to the main branch.</p>
<p>During the discussion, someone complained that with trunk based development changes are not evident. I agree in part with this, as using a separate branch would show the entire diff, while splitting the change in multiple commits would not show the entire feature at once. However, the point of trunk-based development is to make small changes, so the features should be separated in small stories, each with its own commit (or short lived branch). This improves the reliability of the team, allowing it to ship faster and estimate better.</p>
<p>A final consideration is about <strong>conflicts</strong>. While in feature branching conflicts are identified only when merging, in trunk-based all the conflicts arise during development. To keep the build releasable and stable the conflict needs to be fixed immediately, and this might seem to slow down the development of new features.</p>
<p>To avoid integration headaches, it’s important to communicate with the team and avoid conflicts in the first place. Also, it&rsquo;s better to catch conflicts and fix them immediately than to wait for a big bang merge. In my opinion, if there is a lot of churn/conflicts in some modules, it means that the architecture should be improved (by splitting the functionality into smaller modules with clear responsibilities).</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The conclusion of the talk was “<em>embrace change</em>”, which is the fundamental principle of eXtreme Programming. I agree with this quote, as change is inevitable in software development (and in life in general).</p>
<p>I never had a collaborative codebase in the way described by Alessio (with trunk based, tdd, pairing and all the other practices), but I think that every team should strive to follow the same principles and practices.</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>In my 2022 review, I said that one of my goals for 2023 was to participate more in communities (meetups, conferences and so on). Well, as a first step to achieving that goal, I attended a meetup hosted by eDreams ODIGEO (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tech-talks-by-edreams-odigeo-milan-hub-inauguration-special-edition-tickets-493515075877"  target="_blank" >here</a>) on January 24th.</p>
<p>For the inauguration of their Milan Hub, eDreams hosted Sandro Mancuso for his talk “A Case for Outside-In Design”, in which he proposes a set of practices and techniques to make business and technology meet when designing and extending a system.</p>
<p>You may already have heard of “Outside-In Design” on this blog <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/"  target="_blank" >before</a>. Sandro’s talk follows the same philosophy and extends it not only to code but to the entire business and product decisions made before coding even begin.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I will share some notes/brief recap of the talk given by Sandro. It’s by no means a complete transcription and may contain my own interpretation of what was said. Go watch his past talks (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSkDu5YgAh4"  target="_blank" >here</a>) for the real deal!</em></p>
<h3 id="developer-biases-and-the-insideoutside-perspective">Developer Biases and The Inside/Outside perspective</h3>
<p>The talk started with a list of biases (most of the time we call them “practices”) that affect software developers. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural biases (procedural, oop, functional, services, event-based)</li>
<li>Design biases (all architectural design patterns such as SOA, Actor model, Hexagonal arch, Microservices and so on..)</li>
<li>Design Direction biases (starting from the persistence, domain, UI, and lastly <strong>incremental outside-in</strong>, the topic of this talk)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time we tend to work led by our biases: a backend developer will start working on the domain model and then implement the details (infrastructure, application); frontend will start working from the design of the UI down to the actual implementation. However, in this way, we end up with a discrepancy between the systems, and this leads to ugly adapter layers to adapt the API exposed by the backend and the data the frontend needs to work.</p>
<p>This behaviour extends also at a higher level, that of business and product design. Technology and product work in parallel tracks, and then need to somewhat meet at the intersection: the top of the backlog. At that moment, it’s more difficult to align the product decisions needed to create value for the company and the system design.</p>
<p>Software design should <strong>serve</strong> the business, and its value should be measured by how much it impacts the business value. Thus, we need to align the two perspectives, inside (technology) and outside (business).</p>
<p>To solve this issue, Sandro proposes a different approach, in which we start from the product and then define lower and lower level abstractions of the system, contrary to the standard inside-out design approach.</p>
<h3 id="outside-in-design">Outside-In Design</h3>
<p>The first thing to do when designing a new system or a set of features for the business is to create a birds-eye view (<strong>product box</strong>) in which we put the main features that bring value, and the main functional areas involved.</p>
<p>Then, we proceed to do <strong>Impact Mapping</strong>, in which we identify the high-level bounded contexts and architecture. Starting from the main goals of the system, we identify its actors and the different impacts they have, on the deliverables (features). Sandro showed an example using mind maps, refining the different levels (actor → impact → feature) on every iteration.</p>
<p>After impact mapping, with <strong>Functional Mapping,</strong> we identify the business flows, the external (and internal) users and systems and connect them, in a way similar to sequence diagrams but using bounded contexts instead of classes. It allows to decide which systems are external and which are internal, and which should become public APIs or internal services. Sandro gave some examples, one in which only one service (the catalogue) was public-facing, and another (checkout) in which all services were public and called by the frontend.</p>
<p><strong>User Interaction via Mockups</strong> is the step in which we see some UI (finally!!). Sandro does the mockups with Balsamiq, as it allows the creation of dynamic wireframes. It’s better to do them with UX experts, in order to have a basic wireframe both for the UX/UI team and the development team (by designing the APIs and the data needed by the frontend).</p>
<p>Finally, we get into the actual software design and implementation with the method we prefer (Inside-Out or Outside-In TDD for example 😏).</p>
<p>All these steps might seem long, but Sandro explained that they are actually short (e.g. product box can be done in an afternoon!) and need to be performed at different intervals (6/12 months for the highest level, then 3/4 months, monthly, 1/2 weeks and finally daily for the actual coding practices).</p>
<h3 id="thats-it">That’s it!</h3>
<p>As you can see, I just wrote a quick summary of Sandro’s talk. The meetup also included a panel with Sandro and three people from eDreams ODIGEO (the CTO Carsten Bernhard, Milan’s Hub Director Luca Pivotto and Agile Director Brett Ansley), in which they continued the argument brought by the talk and expanded with other content (e.g. how to tackle and measure technical debt, what is value and much more). I didn’t include it in this post as I didn’t take notes 😅.</p>
<p>Overall, the meetup was really interesting. The outside-in perspective is (as in the last meetup I attended) a great way to meet the tech side of the business (working on the nitty-gritty details and implementation) and the product side (concerned with value, customers and overall functionality of the system).</p>
<p>I think that this could be really useful in both big companies (to iterate on new features) and in startups (to design the first system in an extensible and “growable” way). During the talk, Sandro mentioned a book that is on my “to read” bookshelf, “<a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book"  target="_blank" >Team Topologies</a>”. Employing an outside-in perspective allows in the end to define these topologies in advance, allowing the system to grow organically and without breaking everything on each iteration.</p>
<p>That’s all for today’s post! Thank you for reading (if anyone is reading this 🤔) and see you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋</p>
<p>Today’s post is about my experience at the <a href="https://www.agileday.it/"  target="_blank" >Italian Agile Days 2022</a>, which I attended in October 2022. I know, it’s way too late to write this, but I still think that remembering the talks I watched will be useful for others 😃.</p>
<p>The Italian Agile Days is a 2-day free conference held in a different city every year, in which people interested in agile practices (programmers and business people alike) gather to talk about agile and development practices.</p>
<p>This year, the conference was held on the Brescia University campus. It was my first in-person conference in 3 years, and seeing live talks and talking with people with the same interests was refreshing and inspiring!</p>
<p>I mostly watched technical talks about programming, but some of the ones you’ll find below drift from pure programming into the realm of philosophy (and psychology), and they were the most interesting.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="talks">Talks</h2>
<p><em>Disclaimer: most talks were in Italian. The videos are available <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/9957525"  target="_blank" >online</a>, here I’ll just post a brief summary and my opinions on the talks.</em></p>
<h3 id="keynote-myth-busting-in-agile-scaling-en---nigel-thurlow">Keynote: Myth busting in agile Scaling (en) - Nigel Thurlow</h3>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/767786361"  target="_blank" >Video</a></p>
<p>Nigel has been the first ever Chief of Agile at Toyota, and while there he created “The Flow System”, a flow-based approach to delivering value built on the Toyota system.</p>
<p>In his keynote, he debunks myths and tries to solve the “format war” between agile practices. The talk is packed full of considerations and stories about agile…so full that I cannot summarise it here without writing everything Nigel says. Please go check it out!</p>
<h3 id="event-sourcing--cqrs-a-light-introduction-en---paolo-banfi">Event Sourcing + CQRS: a light introduction (en) - Paolo Banfi</h3>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/768885882"  target="_blank" >Video</a></p>
<p>In this talk, the speaker introduces two important concepts that allow to easily change and add functionalities to our systems: event sourcing and CQRS.</p>
<p>To explain them, he presents an example based on a shopping cart, showing that by just saving the current state of the system (as we usually do with databases) we lose information that could be useful to the business. By using event sourcing and CQRS strategies, we employ a more generic model that allows using these pieces of information without making the system much more complex than before.</p>
<p>Paolo does a great introduction to both arguments. Even if I never used event sourcing and CQRS before, I now feel like I should use them in all my future projects!</p>
<h3 id="diamo-una-chance-a-una-codebase-legacy-it---nicola-mincuzzi">Diamo una chance a una codebase legacy? (it) - Nicola Mincuzzi</h3>
<p>“Let’s give a legacy codebase a chance”</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/768879474"  target="_blank" >Video</a></p>
<p>Working with legacy codebases is a dread. Legacy systems are unstable, and every change to their code or structure leads to bugs and unknown issues, given their lack of tests.</p>
<p>In his talk, Nicola shows a project on which he worked, and describes how he “attacked” the legacy monster by using harnesses and a lot of testing. He basically followed the advice in Michael Feather’s “Working Effectively With Legacy Code&quot; which was effective for real!</p>
<p>Given that this was his first talk, it was great. I’m also working on a nasty legacy project, and seeing other people&rsquo;s (successful) experiences is inspiring and comforting at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="ive-done-tdd-wrong-all-the-time-it---luca-giuberti">I’ve done TDD wrong all the time (it) - Luca Giuberti</h3>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/768875860"  target="_blank" >Video</a></p>
<p>In this talk, Luca expresses a common concern that we all think about while writing tests - Am I testing too much the implementation? Do the tests reflect the <strong>what</strong> (the business need), or do they represent the <strong>how</strong> (implementation)?</p>
<p>Luca shows a more sustainable way to test, in a <strong>coarse-grained</strong> fashion. I find this more in line with how I usually test, by testing the behaviour of multiple/larger modules and not of the single classes and methods (with a lot of mocking).</p>
<p>The definition of “unit” is quite confusing. Some of us end up testing single classes or methods in isolation, by mocking every external dependency. Luca’s talk advocates for a coarser grain, like testing multiple (cohesive) classes for their external behaviour. It might seem like integration testing, but it’s not, and I think is a more sound approach.</p>
<h3 id="larte-dello-sviluppatore-it---marco-fracassi">L’arte dello sviluppatore (it) - Marco Fracassi</h3>
<p>“The software developer art”</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/768873513"  target="_blank" >Video</a></p>
<p>In this philosophical (and humorous) talk, Marco talks about the role of creativity (and how to get creative) in software development.</p>
<p>Software developers are a creative species, despite the stereotypes that others associate with the role (and we get a huge list in the talk). Practices such as pair programming, TDD and DDD are indeed quite creative and, at the time of their definition, were revolutionary.</p>
<p>Software development is a social activity in addition to technical practices, and in this regard, creativity can help us solve problems better. Marco presents a lot of ways to increase creativity personally and in the workplace (by increasing psychological safety) and what tends to stop it (ignorance, hyper-specialization, fear, vanity etc..).</p>
<p>In the end, the talk was very inspiring and showed that there’s a lot of “art” in our practice as software developers.</p>
<h3 id="dal-carbone-al-software-i-sistemi-socio-tecnici-it---ferdinando-santacroce">Dal carbone al software: i sistemi socio-tecnici (it) - Ferdinando Santacroce</h3>
<p>“From coal to software: socio-technical systems”</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/768881541"  target="_blank" >Video</a></p>
<p>Agile is not just for programmers, and Ferdinando shows us why in his talk. He tells a story set in post-war England, when a technological innovation (the “longwall”) was introduced but didn’t improve productivity, all because of social issues.</p>
<p>The researchers found out that this innovation disrupted (in a bad way) the current social organisation of the mines. From autonomous, cross-functional and trusted teams, the longwall brought hyper-specialisation, control and loss of autonomy and ownership, leading to lower productivity.</p>
<p>This story serves as a reminder that all techniques and practices we see today in agile (such as lean, kanban, XP etc..) didn’t start with programming, but are way older. In addition, we cannot only think about the technical aspects of the organisation, because the social ones are way more important!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed attending this conference!</p>
<p>Each talk explored an argument which I didn’t know and wanted to know more about. I also got to meet new people in a community near me (Brescia is right next to Bergamo and Milan) and I also got gadgets 🤩. In addition, I bought two books from Avanscoperta: “Cronache di Domain-Driven Design” (DDD Chronicles) and “Decision-Making for Software Development Teams”. I hope to read them soon!</p>
<p>That’s all for today. I hope you enjoyed this short summary of my experience at IAD2022, and I hope to attend and write about next year’s conference (and some workshops? 😇).</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Like every blogger out there, it’s time to write a “2022 Wrap-Up”! In this (short) post, I’ll give a recap of what happened last year, and write down my goals for 2023.</p>
<p>So, let’s start!</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This recap is mostly written by me and <strong>for</strong> me. I don’t expect it to be a beautifully written and engaging piece for other people. It might get boring, you’ve been warned.</em></p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I didn’t do anything exceptional this year.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Anyone writing on the internet brags about changing companies, getting promoted, creating new businesses and so on.</p>
<p>I just… worked 😅.</p>
<p>By this, I don’t mean my job has been boring, indeed! I learned a lot during this year. A few arguments I dabbled myself with include:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST API development with .NET 6</li>
<li>A bit of frontend with React</li>
<li>CI/CD pipelines for .NET and React on Bitbucket (and deploying on Azure services)</li>
<li>How to manage BLE and ANT+ devices from a Unity application</li>
<li>IoT C++ development on a yocto board (and how to use the CANOpen protocol to communicate with devices)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see it’s quite diverse stuff. I didn’t do all at the same time, but given the variety of startups we support, I always need to wear many hats (even while staying an individual contributor).</p>
<p>The thing I’m most proud of has been introducing CI/CD pipelines in a greenfield project. I was able to enforce testing and pull requests/review in the backend team (even without being team lead or even senior) and I hope that this will increase the project quality and stability over time.</p>
<p>Also, working both on backend systems and IoT boards is very fun, as I get to see the entire system and all its components working together.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<h3 id="home-sweet-home">Home sweet home</h3>
<p>This year I managed to buy a house and move in with my girlfriend 🏠.</p>
<p>It has been quite an adventure, all because of some bureaucratic issues. The old owners didn’t actually own part of the house, so we ended up doing a three-way act… it was like living a real-life merge conflict in git 😂.</p>
<p>Other than that, we didn’t have any other issues (e.g. didn’t do any work on the house itself, and already had a furnished bathroom and kitchen). We still need to buy lamps (we are living with lightbulbs hanging from the walls and ceiling) but otherwise, it’s perfect.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-work---pros-and-cons">Hybrid work - Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>This year marked the 3rd year in a row in which I’ve been working remotely (for 2/3 days out of 5 a week). Some considerations (read more <a href="/blog/remote-work-opinions" >here</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pro</strong>: I was able to start exercising a bit on the work-from-home days</li>
<li><strong>Pro</strong>: I got to enjoy my new house more (also, working with my cat close to me is purrfect!)</li>
<li><strong>Con</strong>: As in past years, I read fewer books (as I was mostly reading them while commuting by train)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I’m pretty satisfied with working remotely, and wish there could be more flexibility from my company. Otherwise, working in the same place as my colleagues is great most of the time. If it wasn’t for the time and cost (and distance!) of commuting, I’d be eager to work in the office most of the time.</p>
<h3 id="blogging-reading-and-learning">Blogging, Reading and Learning</h3>
<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>I finally managed to start blogging! Even if I just wrote two articles (and this one) on the blog and started in December, it’s still an achievement.</p>
<p>I’ve always looked up to writers and creators, as they are able to channel their thoughts and creativity into something that can be enjoyed by others.</p>
<p>I hope to keep writing on this blog. Right now I have no idea on how to evolve it (personal articles, book summaries, programming-related stuff etc..), but I’m sure I will find inspiration to write somewhat regularly.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I love reading. I usually read while commuting (one of the only perks of not working remotely all the time, I just cannot concentrate the same at home) and sometimes in the evening instead of watching TV.</p>
<p>Reading is a great way to disconnect from the outside world and enter new dimensions. Fiction allows living new experiences (that I could never do myself, as in fantasy stories), while non-fiction allows absorbing an entire life of work and study of the author in our brain. I usually read non-fiction and programming-related books for this reason, but also like to disconnect completely and read fiction sometimes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m not used to taking notes and making summaries, so for now I’ll post the list. I hope to write some summaries next year!</p>
<p>This year I read 32 books, here’s the complete list (in chronological order):</p>

<li>“<em>The 5AM Club</em>” by Robin Sharma</li>
<li>“<em>The Courage to be Happy</em>” by Ichiro Kishimi</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>Learning is one of my core values. I think that keeping my brain sharp and filling it with (good) stuff is the best way to improve myself and live a fuller life.</p>
<p>As you have just seen from the latest section, I also love to read, so most of my learning is done through the written medium.</p>
<p>In addition to reading, I also participated in a couple of conferences and meetups, mostly in the last months:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://extra.codemotion.com/conference-milan-2022/"  target="_blank" >Codemotion Milan 2022</a> (online, didn’t manage to buy the tickets for the live conference..)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.agileday.it/"  target="_blank" >Italian Agile Day 2022</a> (my <a href="/blog/2022-italian-agile-days" >summary</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/xpugbg/"  target="_blank" >XPUG Bergamo Meetups</a>
<ul>
<li>“Vent’anni dopo”… la prima volta che ho letto XP eXplained</li>
<li>eXtreme Programming linter: aggiusta XP quando si rompe</li>
<li>Mars Rover Kata, un approccio outside-in (I wrote a <a href="/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/" >summary</a> of this)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no learning without practice. In December I started learning the Rust programming language, by following the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/"  target="_blank" >book</a>. To practice using it, I started solving the 2022 Advent of Code with it (<a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/adventofcode"  target="_blank" >github</a>). I haven’t finished all the challenges yet (I’m stuck on the infamous 16th day 😅) but I think AoC is a great way to experiment and learn and I’ll continue with it even after the holidays.</p>
<h2 id="new-year-resolutions">New year resolutions</h2>
<p>2022 has been a great year. I wasn’t able to fulfil all my goals (for example, I definitely didn’t lose 10 kg of weight…) but it was a fun and nice adventure.</p>
<p>I’m not used to making new year&rsquo;s resolutions, as I usually set a goal whenever it comes to my mind. This time I’ll try to list some main topics and goals for next year.</p>
<h3 id="1-learn-in-public">1. Learn in public</h3>
<p>I think that “learn in public” summarizes quite well my main goal for next year.</p>
<p>The term has been created by swix (<a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/"  target="_blank" >here</a>) and it basically means to create a habit of learning and creating content out of it. For example, while learning a new programming language, you might write a blog post or tutorial explaining the language features you are learning, or create videos and podcasts about new concepts you just read about. It also means reaching other people interested in the same thing you are learning (making courses, speaking at conferences, reaching people with questions.. and so on).</p>
<p>So, in 2023 my main goal will be to share what I learn. I might do it by writing here, creating github repos (as I already did with Advent Of Code, but I might do it even with basic Rust stuff) or on other channels. Mostly programming-related stuff, but I may also write some book summaries or conference recaps.</p>
<h3 id="2-improve-as-a-backend-developer">2. Improve as a Backend developer</h3>
<p>I’ve been working as a Software Engineer for more than 3 years today. I’m still at the beginning of my career but have tried different technologies and domains (e.g. Industrial Robotics and Computer Vision, IoT platforms, Cloud Services, Desktop applications, Games and so on).</p>
<p>I now think it’s time to concentrate on a single aspect of software engineering, which is backend and systems programming (with a bit of DevOps).</p>
<p>Since university I’ve been fascinated by distributed systems and large-scale applications, so 2023 will be dedicated to improving my knowledge and practice on backend technologies and architectures.</p>
<p>Obviously being a “T-shaped” developer is my final goal, so I won’t disregard other fields (such as frontend, in which I definitely suck).</p>
<h3 id="3-attend-more-meetups-and-conferences">3. Attend more Meetups and Conferences</h3>
<p>In the last months, I was able to participate in a couple of conferences and meetups, and I really liked it 😁. It allows me to get an updated overview of entire fields/domains and to meet new people.</p>
<p>Next year the goal is quite simple: participate in more (live) conferences! I already accepted to go to an “un-conference” in march with some XPUGBg people. As for other conferences, I’ll see which ones are programmed at the beginning of the year (next week) and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>I don’t plan to propose any talk anywhere as I feel I’m still not experienced enough, but just attending will be ok, it’s still an adventure.</p>
<h3 id="4-take-care-of-my-body-and-mind">4. Take care of my Body and Mind</h3>
<p>Even if I put this goal at the end of the list, it surrounds the other three and is actually the basis to improve in all the rest. My goal for this year is to take care of my health and my mind.</p>
<p>I already started doing a bit of exercise at home, and next year I will continue to do so. In addition, I’ll think more about nutrition and what I put inside my body.</p>
<p>Finally, improving my “mental” nutrition is essential (and is also covered by the previous goals). Learning new stuff (not only programming-related) is the best way to keep my brain exercised and healthy. Also, I hope to improve my concentration by removing bad habits (such as too much youtube surfing) and introducing new good ones (meditation and deep work).</p>
<h2 id="see-you-next-year">See you next year!</h2>
<p>This was a brief recap of what I think about 2022. See you in 2023!! 🎉</p>

          <p>Hi! 👋</p>
<p>Today I will write about a meetup I attended this December, hosted by XPUGBg (Extreme Programming User Group Bergamo). The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/xpugbg/"  target="_blank" >XPUGBg</a> is an association promoting and organizing events related to extreme programming in the Bergamo region.</p>
<p>In this meetup, the guests (Marco Consolaro and Alessandro Di Gioia from <a href="https://alcor.academy/"  target="_blank" >Alcor Academy</a>) performed a live mob programming session with the audience, to solve the <a href="https://github.com/makomweb/mars-rover"  target="_blank" >mars rover kata</a>. We learned how to do mob programming, and how the Outside-In TDD approach works.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-extreme-programming">What is Extreme Programming?</h2>
<p>Extreme programming (XP) is a set of values, principles and practices introduced by Kent Beck at the end of the 1990s. Its goals are to improve the software quality and the team&rsquo;s responsiveness to requirements changing during development. I might write my opinions on this methodology in a new blog post, but for now, I’ll redirect you to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658"  target="_blank" >book</a>, which definitely explains it better than I do 😉.</p>
<p>I discovered extreme programming later this year while attending the XPUG meetups. I also read Kent Beck’s book and I’m actively trying to introduce some practices (like TDD and pair programming) into my current team, but I’m still far from a full XP practitioner. Still, the argument is really interesting.</p>
<p>How does it apply to this meetup? We followed a practice called <strong>mob programming</strong>, in which there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>driver</strong> (Alessandro), the developer actually writing code on the editor</li>
<li>the <strong>navigator</strong>, which instructs the driver on what to write (and sometimes also how)</li>
<li>the <strong>mob</strong>, other members of the team which can discuss with the navigator to improve the code, find possible issues and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>during the meetup, Marco and Alessandro proposed an extended approach (called <strong>fish bowl</strong>), in which the mob is composed of 5 members of the audience, which rotate after some time. So, in addition to the standard mob, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>facilitator</strong> (Marco) guiding the mob and the navigator and deciding when to rotate roles and members</li>
<li>the <strong>audience</strong>, watching it all. Anyone can then enter the fish bowl when he thinks he can give something to the discussion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-kata">What is a Kata?</h2>
<p>“Kata” is a term borrowed from martial arts. It is “a detailed choreographed
 pattern of movements made to be practised alone. It can also be reviewed within groups and in unison when training” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata"  target="_blank" >Wikipedia</a>).
Developers have taken this term and applied it to their set of movements, which are coding, testing and designing. A kata is a short problem/exercise meant to be practised a lot of times. The same kata can be practised with different languages, approaches and methodologies, giving each time a new perspective.</p>
<p>In our case, in this meetup, we practised the mars rover kata, and the twists were to practice it with <strong>mob programming</strong> and <strong>outside-in TDD</strong>. Double trouble!</p>
<p>In the mars rover kata, you have to implement a rover moving on the surface of mars. You are given the initial coordinates of the rover (x, y) and the initial orientation (N, S, E, W). Then, you are given the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>L → rotate left by 90°</li>
<li>R → rotate right by 90°</li>
<li>M → move forward one grid point, maintaining the same position</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should output the position of the rover after applying the commands (X, Y coordinates and direction).</p>
<p>During the meetup (because of lack of time and a lot of discussions) we were able to implement only the simplest version, with the rotate left and move forward commands, and without the I/O translation code (from a text file to actual commands and positions). This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the kata was a failure. On the contrary, it was very useful to see different opinions and approaches to the problem at hand.</p>
<h2 id="outside-in-approach">Outside-In approach</h2>
<p><strong>Outside-in</strong> is an approach to develop software in tandem with TDD. It works by starting from the outer layer (”outside”) and, guided by tests, creating the underlying layers (”in”) of the software.</p>
<p>In practice, the mob started (guided by marco) with the acceptance tests, the outermost layer of testing. These tests should be in a language understandable by the business, as they indicate whether the problem is solved from the business perspective. The first consideration is that the acceptance tests used the actual input and output strings to test the behaviour of the system (see <a href="https://github.com/makomweb/mars-rover"  target="_blank" >here</a> for the example). This meant that the code needed a sort of “translator” to translate the inputs to domain objects, and the domain objects to outputs.</p>
<p>The outside-in approach turned out to be difficult to assimilate because it turned my perception of the design upside-down. Starting from the acceptance tests, it was difficult to turn the tests green, and we had to dive deeper and create a lot of code (first the rover controller, then the rover, then the position with coordinates and direction, and so on) before passing our first test.</p>
<p>In addition, we had to use mocks immediately to avoid writing the translator. Marco presented this to us as a challenge: most of the business value and complexity actually resides in the rover code, not the I/O, so it was a good way to concentrate on the core features of the kata.</p>
<p>In the end, we were able to turn our first test green, and it was already time to head to the pub, so… the rest was left as an exercise for the viewers 😇.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The meetup was really interesting, and it helped me learn new concepts. Even if I didn’t participate in the mob but just watched, I exercised my “design muscles” during the session and my brain was always comparing alternatives and thinking about the code.</p>
<p>Marco and Alessandro are great teachers: Marco was a great facilitator and guided the mob to the right solution, while Alessandro was a thoughtful driver with opinions, also helping the mob to cooperate.</p>
<p>The outside-in approach was new for most of the audience, and even experienced developers discussed how to design the solution and how to proceed. They created a lot of classes seemingly “doing nothing” at the moment, but later it all made sense. This is quite different from standard TDD, in which you just write the code needed to pass the tests and then refactor. Outside-In helps to reduce the refactoring stage, which always leads to rewriting big chunks of the code.</p>
<p>Finally, I never tried practising a kata. I think it is a really useful technique to learn new concepts with a known problem, and I’ll use it more in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now 🎉. Thank you for reading and see you next time!.</p>

          <p>Hi! Welcome to my first post on this blog, I hope there will be others soon!</p>
<p>Today I felt inspired after reading an article from Bennet Garner (<a href="https://medium.com/developer-purpose/remote-work-is-here-to-stay-youll-never-make-me-go-back-205c966408b5"  target="_blank" >here</a>). He writes every day in his newsletter about software development and finding purpose in your job/life. I’ll try to follow his advice and write regularly, but for sure I cannot promise anything like a daily post.</p>
<p>By the way, Bennet’s article is about remote working: its pros, cons and why it’s going to last in our society. Take a look at it!</p>
<p>In this short post, I’d like to give my take on the argument.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: all these are my opinions (as a software engineer) and may not apply to other professions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-remote-for-you">What is remote (for you)?</h2>
<p>Remote working comes in different sizes and formats. Every company likes to adapt its definition to its culture and means of working. Also, when we talk about remote working, we might intend it in widely different ways.</p>
<p>I currently distinguish between these forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full remote: work from anywhere, without constraints on where, when and how. Work is asynchronous and based not on “productivity” (ass-on-chair) but on goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hybrid: work from anywhere but can come to the office at any time to have in-person meetings, team building days, or to use devices you don’t have at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Hybrid” (the Italian way, also called “smart working”): you can work from anywhere, but it must be a private place (for privacy reasons), must be reachable (by phone or chat) in predefined hours, have a maximum number of remote days a week and at any moment you might be requested to come to the office. You should be measured based on value but instead are still measured by the number of hours you are “visible”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess which kind of remote work I’m doing right now? 😅</p>
<p>I’m currently working from home 2 out of 5 days a week and coming into the office for the rest. Given that I’m on a “forced hybrid” approach, I think I can list both the advantages and disadvantages I see with remote working (spoiler: I’d be in favour of the office if commute time is almost absent, but otherwise give me remote please!).</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<h3 id="no-commute-time">No commute time</h3>
<p>Working from anywhere means, most of the time, leaving the office behind. Apart from physical tasks that need the office (like embedded software with difficult-to-move objects, tests at the client site, and happy hours with coworkers 😛) the rest of the work can be done from home or from other places (coffee shops, coworking spaces etc..).</p>
<p>In most cases, this means working near or at home, which means not doing any commute!</p>
<p>When I commute, it usually takes 3/4 hours of my life away from me every day (as we say at work: “time given to the road” or “time wasted to the rails”). I can still take advantage of the situation by reading and sleeping on the train, but it also adds a lot of useless stress (traffic, delays and so on).</p>
<p>With remote work, I can regain this time. Time to sleep, exercise, read, learn and care about myself.</p>
<h3 id="time-flexibility">Time flexibility</h3>
<p>By removing the office, you also remove the need to work simultaneously with all your colleagues. Most of the time companies institute “core hours” in which you should be available for meetings and knowledge sharing, but otherwise you can work whenever is better for you.</p>
<p>For example, I sometimes take some time off during the day to clean my house, walk or read/watch something interesting, without the fear of “wasting time”.</p>
<p>In addition, having time flexibility means working when you are most productive. I tend to work a lot better in the morning (8-12 AM) and late afternoon (4-7 PM), while in the in-between hours I feel less productive. When I’m in the office, my second productive slot of time is wasted because I worry about taking the train (at 5.30 PM), while when I’m working from home I can keep going and finish my task more efficiently. This means I can also do lighter tasks (or nothing at all!) in my “unproductive” time.</p>
<h3 id="more-privacy-sometimes">More privacy (sometimes)</h3>
<p>Unless you work from a cafè or a coworking, most of the time “remote” = “home” or another personal place. Not being in an office, I don’t have to worry about someone staying over my shoulder to check my progress or complain that I’m not working enough. It also means less noise (if you want) and fewer distractions from co-workers.</p>
<p>Obviously, this doesn’t apply to all people. For example, parents have kids running in the house, and pets can also be very noisy and distracting, Finally, the sofa or the bed might be the worst distraction of them all: “why don’t I just rest a little on the sofa? 5 minutes and I’ll back”.</p>
<p>All said, remote wins here.</p>
<h2 id="why-would-you-want-to-go-to-the-office">Why would you want to go to the office?</h2>
<p>Given all the benefits given by remote working, why should someone still want to work in an office?</p>
<p>I can give some perspective about this, as I’m currently working more from the office than remotely (3 out of 5 days a week). By the way (spoiler) I’m still torn between the two options, mostly because of the following reasons.</p>
<h3 id="socialization">Socialization</h3>
<p>“You can socialise remotely”. Yes, but I think meeting in person is still better (even as an introvert).</p>
<p>Staying in the same room together helps to “glue” people together and allows them to read the room in an instant.</p>
<p>Some of this can be done remotely, but would you keep the camera and/or audio on for the entire day when working from home (or worse, from outside)? You can still call your colleagues for a quick chat, but this is far from walking to them, tapping their shoulders and chatting in real life. Yes, it’s distracting and “unproductive”, and sometimes can be daunting (and toxic) but, in the right environment, it can also be fun.</p>
<h3 id="commuting-reprise">Commuting (reprise)</h3>
<p>Yes, I have a 4-hour commute, but when I commute I’m detached from the world outside and can do stuff I wouldn’t do that much at home. This applies to me as I commute by train and underground, so I can read, write and sleep on them.</p>
<p>Commuting also makes me aware of the time passing while working (I have to stop working or I won’t come home in time for dinner 😂) and helps to detach from work and arrive less worried/stressed by it at home.</p>
<p>Finally, commuting helped me cultivate friendships I wouldn’t have found by staying at home (I call them my “train friends”).</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-the-verdict">So, what is the verdict?</h2>
<p>Given all these pros/cons, what do I think about remote working?</p>
<p>As Bennet writes in his article, I think it’s here to stay for a long time. For some situations and tasks the office needs to stay (and to really socialise with colleagues), but otherwise just let me work remotely:</p>
<ul>
<li>More productive (less distraction and I can work when I am more productive)</li>
<li>Work based on real goals and not on “time on chair” metrics</li>
<li>More time to improve, relax and learn (and enjoy my life in a less stressful way)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think many companies still need to fully understand remote and asynchronous work, and hope most of them will embrace it and take advantage of all the benefits in the near future.</p>
