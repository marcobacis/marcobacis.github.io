Today I will write about a meetup I attended this December, hosted by XPUGBg (Extreme Programming User Group Bergamo). The XPUGBg is an association promoting and organizing events related to extreme programming in the Bergamo region.
In this meetup, the guests (Marco Consolaro and Alessandro Di Gioia from Alcor Academy) performed a live mob programming session with the audience, to solve the mars rover kata. We learned how to do mob programming, and how the Outside-In TDD approach works.</description></item><item><title>Remote working?</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 18:36:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</guid><description>Hi! Welcome to my first post on this blog, I hope there will be others soon!
Today I felt inspired after reading an article from Bennet Garner (here). He writes every day in his newsletter about software development and finding purpose in your job/life. I‚Äôll try to follow his advice and write regularly, but for sure I cannot promise anything like a daily post.
By the way, Bennet‚Äôs article is about remote working: its pros, cons and why it‚Äôs going to last in our society.</description></item></channel></rss>
