This post is a short summary (with personal notes and opinions here and there) of the XPUGBg (Bergamo’s eXtreme Programming User Group) meetup I attended in March.
Actually, it’s just a bunch of notes and ideas connected together by my imagination and opinions 😂 (as I already did here and here).
This month&amp;rsquo;s talk was titled “The Actor Model and why an XP programmer should know it” by Emanuele DelBono.</description></item><item><title>Book Summary: Atomic Habits</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/atomic-habits-book/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/atomic-habits-book/</guid><description>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!
Today I’m publishing the (raw) notes I took while reading “Atomic Habits: An Easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones”, by James Clear.
Even though I read this book two years ago, I stumbled across this notes and they were helpful in remembering its main ideas and concepts. I know there are many summaries and reviews of this book.</description></item><item><title>My Experience at FOSDEM 2023</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-my-fosdem-experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-my-fosdem-experience/</guid><description>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post.
Today I just want to share some comments about my trip to FOSDEM 2023. This blog is starting to look like a travel blog for meetups and conferences 😅… I promise I’ll post some programming (practical and not) content soon.
As I already said in my 2022 review, one of my goals for 2023 is to attend more conferences and participate more in communities.</description></item><item><title>XPUGBg January meetup: “eXtreme Collaborative Codebase”</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-jan-xp-codebase-meetup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 07:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-jan-xp-codebase-meetup/</guid><description>Hi 👋 welcome to a new post!
Today I’m going to post a little summary of my experience at the XPUGBg meetup I attended at the end of January. This time, the talk was “eXtreme Collaborative Codebase” by Alessio Coser.
What is a collaborative codebase? Alessio started his talk with a question: what does it mean to collaborate in a codebase for you? What does it take to do it? What are the practices we can use to “work well”?</description></item><item><title>A Case for Outside-In Design: Sandro Mancuso @ Tech Talks by eDreams ODIGEO</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/outside-in-design-edreams-meetup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 22:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/outside-in-design-edreams-meetup/</guid><description>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!
In my 2022 review, I said that one of my goals for 2023 was to participate more in communities (meetups, conferences and so on). Well, as a first step to achieving that goal, I attended a meetup hosted by eDreams ODIGEO (here) on January 24th.
For the inauguration of their Milan Hub, eDreams hosted Sandro Mancuso for his talk “A Case for Outside-In Design”, in which he proposes a set of practices and techniques to make business and technology meet when designing and extending a system.</description></item><item><title>My Experience at the Italian Agile Days 2022: Talks and Reflections</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-italian-agile-days/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-italian-agile-days/</guid><description>Hi 👋
Today’s post is about my experience at the Italian Agile Days 2022, which I attended in October 2022. I know, it’s way too late to write this, but I still think that remembering the talks I watched will be useful for others 😃.
The Italian Agile Days is a 2-day free conference held in a different city every year, in which people interested in agile practices (programmers and business people alike) gather to talk about agile and development practices.</description></item><item><title>2022: A Review</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/</guid><description>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!
Like every blogger out there, it’s time to write a “2022 Wrap-Up”! In this (short) post, I’ll give a recap of what happened last year, and write down my goals for 2023.
So, let’s start!
Disclaimer: This recap is mostly written by me and for me. I don’t expect it to be a beautifully written and engaging piece for other people. It might get boring, you’ve been warned.</description></item><item><title>XPUGBg December meetup: “Mars Rover Kata, an outside-in approach”</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/</guid><description>Hi! 👋
Today I will write about a meetup I attended this December, hosted by XPUGBg (Extreme Programming User Group Bergamo). The XPUGBg is an association promoting and organizing events related to extreme programming in the Bergamo region.
In this meetup, the guests (Marco Consolaro and Alessandro Di Gioia from Alcor Academy) performed a live mob programming session with the audience, to solve the mars rover kata. We learned how to do mob programming, and how the Outside-In TDD approach works.</description></item><item><title>Remote working?</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 18:36:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</guid><description>Hi! Welcome to my first post on this blog, I hope there will be others soon!
Today I felt inspired after reading an article from Bennet Garner (here). He writes every day in his newsletter about software development and finding purpose in your job/life. I’ll try to follow his advice and write regularly, but for sure I cannot promise anything like a daily post.
By the way, Bennet’s article is about remote working: its pros, cons and why it’s going to last in our society.</description></item></channel></rss>
