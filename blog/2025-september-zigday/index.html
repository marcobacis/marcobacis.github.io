Last time was last year for <a href=/blog/2024-update-conference/>Update Conference</a>, and I really miss writing this kind of posts! To keep my writing muscle active, I will start writing more of these üòÅ. I&rsquo;m doing it for selfish reasons, but if I can reach more people and have them discover new events, then I&rsquo;ve reached my goal.</p><p>Today I want to talk about my first time at <a href=https://zig.day/ target=_blank>ZigDay</a>, an event similar to <a href=https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/open-source-saturday-milano/ target=_blank>Open Source Saturday</a>, but all about Zig!!</p><p>The event was organized by <a href=https://www.codingbunker.it/ target=_blank>Coding Bunker</a> (in particular by <a href=https://inge.4pr.es/ target=_blank>Francesco</a> and <a href=https://github.com/omissis target=_blank>Claudio</a>) and hosted by <a href=https://www.mollie.com/ target=_blank>Mollie</a> in their new Milan office.</p><h3 id=zig>Zig?</h3><p>What is Zig?</p><blockquote><p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.</p></blockquote><p>Zig is basically C&mldr; but simpler, more powerful, and I would say prettier too. It sits alongside other low-level languages such as Rust and Go, with a simpler philosophy for control flow, memory management, and project structure.</p><p>See the <a href=https://ziglang.org/ target=_blank>official website</a> to know more (I wanted to include a sample zig program showcasing all the main features, but I don&rsquo;t know it enough üòÖ not even to force a LLM to create it for me).</p><h3 id=event-journal>Event Journal</h3><p>This is how the day unfolded:</p><p>I arrived at the Mollie office at 9:30 AM. We had a short breakfast, then <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescogualazzi/ target=_blank>Francesco</a> introduced the event. Each of us introduced ourselves and shared what we wanted to do that day.</p><p>Being the first time I used Zig, I proposed to see what others were doing and learn using <a href=https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/#ziglings target=_blank>ziglings</a> (like rustlings, but for Zig).</p><p>Other participants had different plans: some contributed to their own projects in Zig (e.g., a JSON schema parser and generator), others experimented with Vulkan/GPUs, played with RISC-V boards, and someone even started <a href=https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/ target=_blank>writing an OS in 1000 lines</a>&mldr;. the usual stuff developers have fun with on a Saturday morning, after all.</p><p>During the first hour and a half, <a href=https://kristoff.it/ target=_blank>Loris</a> showed us how to install Zig and how a Zig project is structured.</p><p>I learned about modules, packages, and how the build system works. The Zig build system is quite powerful: you can define custom commands, modules, and targets, all in Zig itself! It&rsquo;s useful to define custom compilation steps or jobs that have to run during the build. The great feature is that it&rsquo;s not limited to Zig only: you can incorporate C/C++ workflows and linking to work with existing libraries.</p><p>Another feature Loris showed us was how Zig manages memory.</p><p>Zig is a low-level language that makes memory management explicit, so it has allocations, deallocation, pointers, heap and stack, and many other concepts. The difference between Zig and existing low-level languages such as C and C++ is that it makes memory allocation explicit, but without compromising the robustness of the software itself!</p><p>Whenever a method allocates memory, it needs to be given an <code>allocator</code>, and in most places, the code must handle allocation errors explicitly: this allows for robust programs.</p><p>Using custom allocators makes the language more versatile (e.g., an allocator for embedded systems behaves differently from one for desktop). This also helps in writing performant tests: the testing allocator can detect memory leaks automatically and allows tracking, showing, and debugging memory allocation.</p><p>After the Zig crash course, I started playing with <a href=https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/#ziglings target=_blank>ziglings</a>. Ziglings are a series of small exercises that introduce Zig features step-by-step. Each exercise is a program with small missing pieces or errors that we must solve to progress. They are a great way to learn the main features of the language, in small steps, and have fun in the process!</p><p>I did the first 39 exercises, and these are some of the things I learned:</p><ul><li>Arbitrary bit-width integers</li><li>Error handling (<code>try</code>, <code>catch</code>, union types, and the <code>?</code> operator)</li><li>The <code>defer</code> and <code>errdefer</code> keywords (useful to handle memory deallocation, logging, and error handling)</li><li>The <code>unreachable</code> keyword (useful in switch and if statements)</li><li>Standard control structures, with Zig&rsquo;s own quirks (e.g., continue expressions)</li><li>Optionals and nice ways to assign &ldquo;no value&rdquo; (in particular, I like how <code>undefined</code> works, which is different from other languages I&rsquo;m used to)</li></ul><p>I still missed a lot of features that I&rsquo;m going to explore next (e.g., <code>slices</code>, <code>comptime</code>, <code>async/await</code>, and the entire standard library), but I think that for my first day of Zig, there was enough!</p><p>At the end of the day, we shared our impressions. Some people gave demos, others shared their opinions or talked about their current projects. At the end, Loris showed us a project he&rsquo;s currently working on: <a href=https://github.com/kristoff-it/superhtml target=_blank>SuperHTML</a>, an LSP for HTML! I discovered how much I DON&rsquo;T know about HTML, and that the web stack is a dark, incoherent platform&mldr;</p><p><em>Update: you can find the final round of presentations on the Zig Day Milano channel (<a href=https://youtu.be/K6ULgtdj1Yg target=_blank>youtube</a> in italian). I didn&rsquo;t present because I just did exercises, nothing much to show üòÖ</em></p><p>So&mldr; that was my Saturday. I hope to have more Saturdays like this üòÄ</p><p>See you next time!</p></div><div class=after-post-tags><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/meetup>meetup</a></li><li><a href=/tags/open-source>open source</a></li><li><a href=/tags/zig>zig</a></li></ul></div><div class="row PageNavigation d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"><a class="d-block col-md-6" href=https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2025-socrates/>&#171; SoCraTes 2025</a>
