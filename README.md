# Marco Bacis Personal Website

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is the repository for my personal website, [marcobacis.dev](https://marcobacis.dev/).

The website is built with [Hugo](gohugo.io) and the [mediumish-gohugo theme](https://github.com/lgaida/mediumish-gohugo-theme). I added some customizations (e.g. improved the rss feed, figures, added captions and some blog page parameters etc...).

## Building
To build the website, install hugo, then run ```hugo --minify``` from the command line. The command will output the static-generate site in the ```public``` directory.

## Contributing

If you find any error on the pages (e.g. grammar error, pages not working, wrong layout, mobile issues etc..) don't hesitate to open an issue on the [issue tracker](//github.com/marcobacis/marcobacis.github.io/issues) if you want to contribute in any possible way.

You can also create a [pull request](//github.com/marcobacis/marcobacis.github.io/pulls) if you have already implemented a new feature that you want to share.
