This page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) ([his now page](https://sive.rs/now), and a [collection of now pages](https://nownownow.com/about)).

A *now page* it's a sort of continuous "status update" one points to when asked "so, what are you doing right now?".

In addition to showing off what I'm up to, it also helps in focusing on less stuff: if something new comes along, I'll do it or say no based on how "crowded" my now page is!
