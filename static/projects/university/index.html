These projects have been developed (and, as all master student research projects, never continued after first completion) during my MSc years at Politecnico di Milano.
BlastFunction
BlastFunction is the project I developed for my master thesis at Politecnico di Milano.
Given the recent growing interest for heterogeneous computing and custom hardware accelerators, there have been a lot of work integrating FPGAs and cloud environments.
However, these devices are still treated as separate entities in the current scenario, meaning that they are used in conjunction with Virtual Machines, but are kept out of container and serverless applications.
BlastFunction targets this opportunities, by offering a distributed FPGA sharing system for the acceleration of microservices and serverless applications in cloud environments."><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Marco Bacis"><meta name=twitter:description content="Past (research) projects These projects have been developed (and, as all master student research projects, never continued after first completion) during my MSc years at Politecnico di Milano.

The resulting accelerator exploits the dataflow computational pattern and inherent parallelism of convolutions and creates a pipeline between the layers of the CNN.
The framework aims to make FPGA more accessible to deep learning users offering a quick and automated way to deploy CNNs on reconfigurable hardware.</p><hr width=100% color=grey size=3px><h2 id=beyestaticprojectsbeye><a href=/static/projects/beye>BEye</a></h2><p>BEye is an application for retinal vessels segmentation running on FPGAs.
The project has been carried out during my last year of bachelor, was a finalist in the <a href=http://www.openhw.eu/2016-finalists.html target=_blank>2016</a> Xilinx Open Harware Competition, and brought to a <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8037052/ target=_blank>publication</a> to the 2017 EMBC conference.
The submitted source code and designs can be found on the <a href=https://bitbucket.org/necst/beye-src target=_blank>public repository</a>.</p><hr width=100% color=grey size=3px><h1 id=past-university-projects>Past University projects</h1><p>Just if you want to have fun of my university course projects, I&rsquo;ll leave them here with a short summary.
In case you are interested, the source code for these projects is hosted on my github <a href=https://github.com/marcobacis target=_blank>profile</a>.</p><h2 id=dispose>DiSPosE</h2><p>Dispose is a distributed stream processing engine, developed for the Distributed Systems course&rsquo;s project at Polimi.
It supports count-based windows and numeric operations, along with a centralized checkpointing and recovery mechanism. (<a href=https://github.com/marcobacis/dispose target=_blank>github</a>).</p><p>In this page I just give a list of other small projects that don&rsquo;t need an entire page to be explained. They are just small projects developed for university courses.</p><hr width=100% color=grey size=3px><h2 id=parallel-graph-matching-algorithm-linkhttpsgithubcommarcobacisparallel_graph_matching>Parallel graph matching algorithm (<a href=https://github.com/marcobacis/parallel_graph_matching target=_blank>link</a>)</h2><p>Project developed for the 2017 course on &ldquo;Advanced Algorithms and Parallel programming&rdquo;.
It consists in the implementation and parallelization of a graph matching algorithms using OpenMP and OpenMPI.
The algorithm is composed of two main phases: a similarity-based computation using the graphs matrices, and an auction-based matching phase.</p><hr width=100% color=grey size=3px><h2 id=flights-queries-using-hadoop-and-spark-linkhttpsgithubcommarcobacismw_spark_bigdata>Flights queries using Hadoop and Spark (<a href=https://github.com/marcobacis/mw_spark_bigdata target=_blank>link</a>)</h2><p>Big Data query and visualization using Hadoop, Spark and a jupyter notebook with Holoviews.
The query are run over a flights database from 1994 to 2008.</p><hr width=100% color=grey size=3px><h2 id=indoor-positioning-using-contiki-ng-linkhttpsgithubcommarcobacismw_iot_person_detection>Indoor positioning using Contiki-ng (<a href=https://github.com/marcobacis/mw_iot_person_detection target=_blank>link</a>)</h2><p>IoT project for the &ldquo;Middleware Technologies for Distributed Systems&rdquo; course, consisting of an IPv6-based presence detection system using MQTT using Contiki-ng and TI-CC2650 boards (and a sensors launchpad).
The position is at room-level, using the room RPL router address to identify the position and an accelerometer to update the location only when the user is standing still for some time.</p><hr width=100% color=grey size=3px><h2 id=stack-size-estimation-using-llvm-linkhttpsgithubcommarcobacisllvm_stacksize>Stack size estimation using LLVM (<a href=https://github.com/marcobacis/llvm_stacksize target=_blank>link</a>)</h2><p>Project developed for the Advanced Computer Architecture course.
It consists in a series of LLVM passes to estimate the stack size of an application in a target-independent way.
The pass gives two estimates: pessimistic and optimistic.
The optimistic estimate is computed by simulating the register allocation, thanks to a user-given register file.
We tested the pass on the polybench suite, and found out stack sizes for different architectures (X86, ARM and NVIDIA).</p></div></div><div class=col-md-1></div></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 text-center text-lg-left">Â© Copyright Marco Bacis</div></div></div></footer></div><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.6/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-wHAiFfRlMFy6i5SRaxvfOCifBUQy1xHdJ/yoi7FRNXMRBu5WHdZYu1hA6ZOblgut crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/mediumish.js></script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-WJJS43TXKN"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-WJJS43TXKN")}</script></body></html>
