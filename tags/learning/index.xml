          <p>Hi üëã¬†and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>This blog is becoming more and more a journal and a collection of book summaries üòÖ¬†I promise I‚Äôll write more about technical stuff soon.</p>
<p>Today I‚Äôm going to give a small summary and comment of a book I recently read: ‚ÄúShow Your Work!‚Äù by <a href="https://austinkleon.com/"  target="_blank" >Austin Kleon</a> . Austin is a ‚Äúwrites who draws‚Äù, and his books on creativity are all formatted in crazy ways (and with a really nice finish)!</p>
<p>In ‚ÄúShow Your Work‚Äù Austin shares some ways in which everyone can share his creative work (even if he doesn‚Äôt think of it as creative, as us programmers!). Let‚Äôs get into it!</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I put some of my comments and ideas in this post, so it‚Äôs not a proper ‚Äúsummary‚Äù, but just some notes with my thoughts attached.</em></p>
<h2 id="a-new-way-of-operating">A New Way of Operating</h2>
<p>Talking about <em>self-promotion</em> is always difficult. Comedian Steve Martin dodges the question by saying ‚ÄúBe so good they can‚Äôt ignore you‚Äù (there&rsquo;s also a book from Cal Newport <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124"  target="_blank" >with the same title</a>). Being good is an obvious way to be found, but is‚Äôt not enough. In order to be found, you must be <em>findable.</em></p>
<p>That‚Äôs the premise of the book. Many creative people have built <em>sharing</em> in their routine, and the this is a sort of manual to learn how to to share small bits of your work, consistently.</p>
<p>Austin shares 10 pieces of advice on how to share creative work and get found. Here I wrote a  summary (I actually re-read the entire book while writing this notes!) of the 10 main chapters of the book.</p>
<h3 id="1-you-dont-have-to-be-a-genius">1. You don‚Äôt have to be a genius</h3>
<p>The first myth that Austin debunks is that of the <em>lone, perfect genius</em> working on his piece of art. The idea of creative work as a lone, antisocial activity is far from the truth! Instead, many works and projects are created by groups of people sharing their interests, something that the author refers as ‚Äú<em>scenius</em>‚Äù. The internet is a perfect example of a scenius, in which everyone can share what they are doing and the results of their work without fear.</p>
<p>The other myth we must debunk is that we need to be <em>expert</em> to share our work. It‚Äôs the complete opposite! Being an <em>amateur</em> has many advantages: amateurs are continuous learners, can learn in public and care less about making mistakes and being ridiculous. In addition, the modern world is making everyone an amateur, so we have no excuses.</p>
<p>A final advice that Austin gives in this chapter is that to <em>find your voice</em>, you must use it! So, forget impostor syndrome and just start sharing what you are learning. I must admit, I‚Äôm not following this point right now, but I think we should all try to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public"  target="_blank" >learn in public</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-think-process-not-product">2. Think process, not product</h3>
<p>The first chapter was more for inspiration, to let us feel that we can indeed share our work even if we are not expert or geniuses. With the second chapter, we get into the practicals of what to share.</p>
<p>In particular, Austin argues that it‚Äôs important to share not only the final <em>product</em> (piece of art, book, software etc..), but also the entire <em>process</em> followed to create the product!</p>
<p>As humans, we are curious and want to know what other human beings are doing, and how they are doing it. Sharing the creative process to create something is a perfect way to  create a bond with the audience and make others part of the process itself.</p>
<p>Think about all the short videos, social posts, pictures that content creators share everyday!</p>
<p>The practical advice of the chapter is then to start collecting small pieces of evidence, the residue of our process, and shape it in some piece of media to share with others.</p>
<p>Some ideas to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>A work log/journal showing the progress, thoughts and ideas explored while working</li>
<li>Pictures/videos/blog posts showing the work in progress and sketches</li>
<li>Day-to-day activities (no matter how boring they may seem, someone will find them interesting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Documenting the process is not only a way to share the work, but also to think about it more critically, to get a sense of progress and to track how things are going.</p>
<h3 id="3-share-something-small-every-day">3. Share something small every day</h3>
<p>The third advice Austin gives us is to ‚Äúshare something small every day‚Äù. Small means updates on an ongoing project, inspirations, notes, sketches and whatever comes out of your work process.</p>
<p>Focusing on every single day helps in creating a habit (see <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/atomic-habits-book/"  target="_blank" >Atomic Habits</a>) and allows to create a bond with other people. Over the years, all of this shared collection will become a piece of work itself.</p>
<p>To share something every day, we can use <strong>both</strong> social media and a personal website. Social media is helpful in creating daily updates and sharing to a larger audience, while a website is our own personal space in which to put all our ideas, progresses and results.</p>
<p>Remember: a website is not a self-promotion machine, but rather a <em>self-invention</em> machine! It represents a big notebook in which to put our thoughts. For example, even if I‚Äôm not creating something every day, I like to write on this blog to have clearer ideas and to better recall what I learn and experience.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also important to remember the first advice, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to be a genius‚Äù. Everyone can share something small, even if he thinks that it‚Äôs crap (I keep thinking like this myself, and still here you are reading my posts üòÖ).</p>
<p>The other excuse is that we don‚Äôt have time to do this, but time can always be found during the day: commuting, waiting in line, lunch break or in the evening (skipping one TV episode is not so bad sometimes). Even if I‚Äôm not writing this blog or programming in every minute of my life, I still try to find some moments to write or save something interesting I found. Just remember (and I usually forget) that this sharing time shouldn‚Äôt interfere with the actual time to do the <strong>work</strong> we are sharing.</p>
<p>Finally, even if all the book is about sharing and showing everything related to our work (creative or not), it‚Äôs important to not <em>overshare</em>. Every time you want to share something, ask ‚Äú<strong>so what?</strong>‚Äù. Share imperfect and unfinished work, share notes and how you get inspired, but don‚Äôt share <em>absolutely everything</em>.</p>
<h3 id="4-open-up-your-cabinet-of-curiosities">4. Open up your cabinet of curiosities</h3>
<p>The fouth advice in how to share our work is to ‚Äúopen up our cabinet of curiosities‚Äù. A cabinet of curiosities was a room filled with exotic and strange pieces (biological or human-made) which went viral in the 16th-17th century, a precursor to modern museums.</p>
<p>We all have a similar place in which we put everything: books we read, movies we watch, art pieces which inspires us, website we visit and so on. We must open our collection and share it with others: it helps in showing our process (creating and collecting are not so different after all) and finding people with the same taste as us.</p>
<p>Another advice is to not feel guilty of the ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù we collect! Be open and honest and don‚Äôt let other people criticise things you genuinely enjoy. On the other hand, don‚Äôt try be ‚Äúhip‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù by criticising other people collections, but use this as an occasion to connect with people.</p>
<p>Finally, don‚Äôt forget to give credit to the authors of the stuff you collect and share! Attribution acts like the label on a museum piece, and allows others to reach the same sources you found and took inspiration from. The easiest way to give credit on the internet is to share a link to the author‚Äôs website, or mentioning them on a post (this also helps with the whole ‚Äúconnection‚Äù idea).</p>
<p>How does this advice translate to my work as a developer? Well, one of the outcomes of this blog is exactly to share stuff which inspires me. Every book, conference or other thing I summarise and share on this site is a something I found interesting, inspiring or useful to my work, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs here üòú.</p>
<h3 id="5-tell-good-stories">5. Tell Good Stories</h3>
<p>The fifth advice Austin gives us is to ‚Äútell good stories‚Äù. We must create a compelling story behind our work, a narration which allows to increase its value.</p>
<p>But shouldn‚Äôt our work <em>speak by itself</em>? Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not like this in the real world. Don‚Äôt forget that we create for other people to consume or admire, and humans look for <em>connection</em>.</p>
<p>The value of something is deeply affected by the <em>story</em> we tell about it. A story helps other people in connecting with our work, be it by sharing the ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù, showing the frustrations, the failures and also the great moments behind a piece.</p>
<p>Of course, good storytelling is a difficult skill to acquire. A good story should follow a proven structure: think about fairy tales or most fiction and non-fiction books. The book highlights some structures to take inspiration from (<a href="https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/story-structure/dan-harmon-story-circle"  target="_blank" >Dan Harmon‚Äôs story circle</a>, <a href="https://bigthink.com/high-culture/vonnegut-shapes/"  target="_blank" >Kurt Vonnegut Graphs</a>, <a href="https://writers.com/freytags-pyramid"  target="_blank" >Gustav Freytag‚Äôs Pyramid</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, everyone of us is in the middle of a story, so we must try to find ‚Äúsub-stories‚Äù to tell: every single thing we share is a <em>pitch</em>, a story with its ending chopped off. A pitch has a starting point (the past), the current story (present) and an open-ended ending, which puts the listener in the hero who decides how it‚Äôs going to end.</p>
<p>A good example of storytelling is when someone asks ‚ÄúSo, what do you do?‚Äù. I must admit that the answer is easy for people with known professions (like me üòõ). Even then, we need to practice our personal story. The important thing is to keep it real (stick to the facts and do not invent!) and to keep in mind the current audience. Telling a story about oneself shouldn‚Äôt be an opportunity to brag about yourself, but to connect to someone else in an honest way.</p>
<h3 id="6-teach-what-you-know">6. Teach what you know</h3>
<p>So, now we know we don‚Äôt need to be genius, are sharing something small about our process every day, opened up our ‚Äúcollection‚Äù and crafted good stories about our work.</p>
<p>What comes after that?</p>
<p>Teaching!</p>
<p>Our work is not secret. Actually, we want to show it to others. Many people think that they should keep their trade secrets, well, secret. But teaching allows to connect more with the audience. By learning something about your work, they will appreciate it more and get more interested.</p>
<p>Moreover, teaching helps in learning better. I won‚Äôt cite the entire quote from Edgar Dale, just this part: ‚Äúwe remember 95% of what we teach others‚Äù. So, as soon as you learn something, turn around and teach it to others!</p>
<h3 id="7-dont-turn-into-human-spam">7. Don‚Äôt turn into human spam</h3>
<p>Up to this point, the book highlighted some ways to share work. In this chapter it warns against becoming ‚Äúhuman spam‚Äù instead.</p>
<p>What is a ‚Äúhuman spam‚Äù? It‚Äôs a person who shares its work and make himself known, but without living in the community before. Everything they say it‚Äôs about their work, while they do not participate in others work.</p>
<p>For example, an artist showing off his skills without watching other artists, a writer who wants to get published without reading the publications himself, or (in my case) a programmer talking about programming without getting involved in programming communities and projects first.</p>
<p>Instead of caring about the number of followers, we should care about the <em>quality</em>, of both the people we connect to and, first, of our work. How can we pretend to be interesting if the work itself isn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>In this regards I must admit that sometimes I feel more like the bad examples of this chapter: I like to share this blog and to know people, but I don‚Äôt work enough on my <em>hard</em> skills (programming) and don‚Äôt participate enough in programming communities (e.g. to share what I know or help others). This chapter is then a wake up call to do so!</p>
<p>A final advice the chapter gives identify and meet up with people with the same interests (Austin gives an example of the ‚ÄúKnuckleballers‚Äù group of baseball pitchers). Meetups are a great way to meet people you already know or follow, or that have your same interests, to share and talk about ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù in your space. It‚Äôs a more intimate form of networking. He also says to just ask people</p>
<h3 id="8-learn-to-take-a-punch">8. Learn to take a punch</h3>
<p>When you share your work in public, you have to be ready for (harsh) criticism. Austin shares some techniques to deal with that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relax and breathe</strong>: criticism is not the end of the world, and most of the time it‚Äôs our brain which imagines the worst outcomes. Just accept whatever comes, you cannot control it</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen your neck</strong>: the way to learn how to take a punch is to take a lot. So just publish a lot, and get out your comfort zone many times to get comfortable with critics</li>
<li><strong>Roll with the punches</strong>: keep moving despite the comments, it might become fun to get your work hated by some people!</li>
<li><strong>Protect your vulnerable areas</strong>: if some work is too sensitive, just keep it hidden‚Ä¶ but do not hide everything from the world!</li>
<li><strong>Keep your balance</strong>: keep what you do (your work) and who you are (yourself) separated</li>
<li><strong>Don‚Äôt feed the trolls</strong>: filter out people who are not interested in you or your work, they just want to roll in the mud with your self-doubt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-sell-out">9. Sell out</h3>
<p>We‚Äôre almost at then end of the sharing advice. After sharing all the behind-the-scenes, teaching, staying humble and taking the punch, it‚Äôs time to <strong>sell</strong> our work.</p>
<p>This chapter doesn‚Äôt resonate much with me (I‚Äôm already paid to do what I do, which is software), but it should be a wake up call to artists to stop thinking that being a ‚Äúsellout‚Äù is bad. After all, most of the art in history was done by commission.</p>
<p>At some point, the creative must take the leap from sharing freely their work to selling it. The first way to do so is to ‚Äúask for donations‚Äù. A simple ‚Äúbuy me a coffee‚Äù button or a patreon account can do miracles. Another way is to ask for funding for your next work, with websites like indiegogo or kickstarter. A note on this method: when a person becomes a patreon or donates something, he will feel entitled to have a say on your work: you can still chose the ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù model of selling stuff if you don‚Äôt want this kind of relation.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method (donations, crowdfunding, standard selling) a good advice is to keep a mailing list, on platforms such as mailchimp or substack. Some people directly make money through these platform, but the real value lies in the mail addresses of the people subscribed: they are the most loyal fans, and every mail will go directly in their inbox (and attention). Whenever you are ready to sell or ask something, they‚Äôll be the first you want to contact.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSelling out‚Äù isn‚Äôt a bad thing. Whenever a new opportunity comes around, check if the new work is something you want to do, and then do it, even if some people will treat you like a sellout‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs their opinion, not yours.</p>
<p>Finally, when (if) you become successful enough, remember to share back with the one who helped you and your fans, but to not become so overwhelmed that you can‚Äôt do your work‚Ä¶ learn to say ‚Äúno‚Äù a lot.</p>
<h3 id="10-stick-around">10. Stick around</h3>
<p>In the last chapter, Austin gives some advice on how to continue with you career (creative or not).</p>
<p>The first advice is to not <strong>quit the show</strong>. Working and creating are difficult, and sometimes we might be tempted to just stop. But most of the reward happens when you stick long enough. This is pretty simple to tell, but difficult to do when it‚Äôs needed (e.g. I should not quit learning continuously new programming methods or this blog!).</p>
<p>The second advice is to keep the momentum, or as Austin calls it, do ‚Äúchain-smoking‚Äù. Whenever you finish and publish a piece, don‚Äôt stop there getting feedback and thinking. Just start a new thing! I must admit to be a victim of this sin. When I finish writing a post for the blog I wait before starting a new one. This leads to me losing momentum, and taking a long time to start again‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Even if the first advice of the chapter is to not quite, at some point in might be useful to <strong>go away</strong> from your work. This can take the form of a long sabbatical, or a small act to do every day (like commuting, exercising or going into the nature). The important thing is to take a break.</p>
<p>Finally, after mastering your current knowledge, it‚Äôs time to begin again (as a student) and find something new to learn. Of course this doesn‚Äôt mean losing all your previous work (you are not quitting your show, remember?), but working on top of it. As all the previous advice says, begin to learn new stuff, document everything and share it with the world.</p>
<h2 id="thats-it">That‚Äôs it!</h2>
<p>I found this book quite useful and inspiring.</p>
<p>Austin showed that showing off your work a little bit evey day is not impossibile, and is not exclusive of prodogies and geniuses.</p>
<p>In fact, I think this book can be an inspiration for everyone to just start sharing something about their work.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s not easy to start! I find it difficult to gather the courage to share something about my work (in fact, until now this blog has been more of a ‚Äújournal‚Äù than a real portfolio for my skills), but in the future I hope this will change for the better.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, and see you next time!</p>

&lt;h2 id="2023-goals-review">2023 Goals Review&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, a short check on the goals I wrote in my 2022 review:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>‚ùìLearn in public&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I definitely tried to expose myself a little more and share what I learned in public.

          <p>Hi üëã¬†and welcome to the last post of 2023!</p>
<p>As already done <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-a-review/"  target="_blank" >last year</a>, it‚Äôs time for a end-of-year recap!</p>
<p>I usually spend the last days of the year eating and laying on the couch (christmas is strong in italy) so don‚Äôt expect a long post.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs begin!</p>
<h2 id="2023-goals-review">2023 Goals Review</h2>
<p>First, a short check on the goals I wrote in my 2022 review:</p>
<p><strong>‚ùìLearn in public</strong></p>
<p>I definitely tried to expose myself a little more and share what I learned in public. Some examples are my blog posts on books I read (<a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/atomic-habits-book/"  target="_blank" >here</a>, <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/philosophy-of-software-design/"  target="_blank" >here</a> and <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/indistractable-book-summary/"  target="_blank" >here</a>), and the github repos for <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/adventofcode"  target="_blank" >Advent Of Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/coding-challenges"  target="_blank" >Coding Challenges</a>.</p>
<p>I left a question mark because I think I could have done more this year, and there‚Äôs room for improvement.</p>
<p>‚ùì¬†<strong>Improve as a Backend Developer</strong></p>
<p>Another goal, another question mark. Even though I got better at working on the backend (e.g. I just read <em>Building Microservices</em> and two books on DDD) I didn‚Äôt work much with backend systems in the last months, focusing more on device communication (e.g. serial port, BLE) and GUIs (in windows) instead of web applications.</p>
<p>This will definitely change next year (see below for why‚Ä¶spoiler: in my new job I‚Äôll work mostly on web applications üòõ).</p>
<p><strong>‚úÖ¬†Attend more meetups and conferences</strong></p>
<p>This is a green flag! I attended a lot of conferences and meetups this year. This helped my in meeting a lot of people and technologies. I documented some of the events in this blog, so make sure to give it a look üòÅ</p>
<p><strong>‚úÖ¬†Take care of my body and mind</strong></p>
<p>The first half of the year was meh (I reached 100Kg and didn‚Äôt exercise), but it got better in the second half: I started to watch more what I eat and started exercising a bit, and right now I‚Äôm about 92Kg with a tiny bit of fat less than before üòÖ.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs deep dive into some aspects of this year, starting with my job as a software engineer/developer/whatever.</p>
<p>The year started with a long-running project finally coming to an end. We finished it by testing with the customer for a last time‚Ä¶..in japan! I went to Okinawa for the tests, and mainland Japan for the final review of the project. In the end, the customer was satisfied by our work and I managed to visit a small japanese town (even if it was just for a day)! I also managed to see sakura trees blooming even if it was march.</p>

<p>From April to October I worked for <a href="https://weart.it/"  target="_blank" >WeArt</a>, a small startup inside e-Novia focusing on haptics for Virtual/Augmented reality. In particular, I worked on their low-level SDK (e.g. <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/docs-as-code-doxygen-awesome/"  target="_blank" >improving the documentation</a>) and their Middleware software (a WinUI/UWP app to communicate with their device).</p>
<p>In WeArt I learned to be more proactive in my work. Being in a small, product-oriented startup shifted my actions from just doing what I was told (common in consulting firms) to actively thinking on how to improve the product itself (in my case, the SDK and Middleware).</p>

<p>Finally, in December I started a new journey in <a href="https://www.zupit.it/"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>!</p>
<p>Zupit is a small software house in Trento (Italy) which focuses on agility, code quality, learning and work-life balance. The most interesting aspect of my new job is that I‚Äôm working only 6 hours per day (part-time) without compromising on productivity.</p>
<p>The work is fast but already rewarding, even after just 1 month since I started: working less hours has led to improved productivity (we still have to ship the same amount!) and to more focus during working hours. In addition to that, I have time to learn, exercise and relax in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I just started, but can‚Äôt wait to get more involved in my new job!</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs been one year since I started this blog!</p>
<p>Overall, I‚Äôm satisfied with how the blog is going. I wrote 13 posts in 2023 including this one (not listing them here, you can visit the blog instead üòõ), so on average I published one post each month.</p>
<p>Most of the posts are about experiences I had (e.g. conferences, meetups and so on) and on books I read and summarised. I still don‚Äôt think I have a lot to say on the technical side that hasn‚Äôt been covered by someone else (impostor syndrome will always be there for me), but I hope to improve my writing and my habits.</p>
<p>One thing I struggled with in 2023 was consistency. I wrote most of the posts in batches (so 2 or 3 at a time) and then postponed their publication to fit the goal of ‚Äúone post each month‚Äù. In November and December I ended up with no post scheduled and I didn‚Äôt write anything in that period, and that‚Äôs why this is the first post in 2 months‚Ä¶.</p>
<p>In 2024 I hope to focus and write more on this blog. Also, I hope to improve my content, adding more technical/programming stuff to the more ‚Äújournal-style‚Äù posts I wrote this year.</p>
<h2 id="conferences-and-meetups">Conferences and Meetups</h2>
<p>This year I finally got the courage to get out and attend some conferences and meetups! I mostly stayed in my zone (physically, meaning Bergamo, Milan and northern italy in general) and attended local events, but I also adventured outside Italy once (for FOSDEM).</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the list of conferences I attended in 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudgen.it/codegen/"  target="_blank" >CodeGen</a> - Verona</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/"  target="_blank" >FOSDEM</a> - Bruxelles ‚Üí <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2023-my-fosdem-experience/"  target="_blank" >My Experience</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ugidotnet.org/e/3087/Web-Day-2023"  target="_blank" >Web Day 2023</a> - Online</li>
<li><a href="https://agilemovement.it/venture/2023/pordenone/"  target="_blank" >Agile Venture</a> - Pordenone</li>
<li><a href="https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/index.html"  target="_blank" >Working Software Conference</a> - Milan ‚Üí <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/working-software-2023/"  target="_blank" >My Experience</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.socrates-conference.it/"  target="_blank" >SoCraTeS</a> - Rimini ‚Üí <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/socrates-2023/"  target="_blank" >My Experience</a></li>
<li><a href="https://conferences.codemotion.com/milan2023-live/"  target="_blank" >Codemotion</a> - Milan</li>
<li><a href="https://www.agileday.it/"  target="_blank" >Italian Agile Days</a> - Milan</li>
</ul>
<p>I also took part in some meetups (again, near Bergamo and Milan). I love meetups as they are smaller and more relaxed than a conference. Meeting the organisers and the speakers over a beer after or during the meetup is 100 times easier than at a big conference!!</p>
<p>Some of the meetups I usually attend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/xpugbg/"  target="_blank" >XPUG Bergamo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/edotechtalks-milan/"  target="_blank" >Tech Talks by eDreams</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/react-js-milano/"  target="_blank" >ReactJS Milano</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/ugidotnet/"  target="_blank" >.NET Italian User Group</a> (UGIdotNet)</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I regret about 2023 is that I attended all these events ‚Äúpassively‚Äù, without ever proposing as a speaker‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to make bold claims and become a speaker in 2024, but moving towards that might be the goal (e.g. speaking at company events, or through this blog or‚Ä¶ who knows, youtube or something similar üòÖ).</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I love reading, both fiction and non-fiction books. Reading allows me to disconnect, relax and either learn something new or distract myself with a good story.</p>
<p>This year I read a bit less than last year (28 books instead of 32). Here‚Äôs the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Noise</em> by Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein</li>
<li><em>Soundtracks: The Surprising Solution to Overthinking</em> by Jon Acuff</li>
<li><em>#Freestyle</em> by Roberto Ottolino</li>
<li><em>Cronache di Domain Driven Design</em> by Various Authors (see more <a href="https://www.avanscoperta.it/it/libri/"  target="_blank" >here</a>)</li>
<li><em>The War of Art</em> by Steven Pressfield</li>
<li><em>The Every</em> by Dave Eggers</li>
<li><em>Solo</em> by Rebecca Seal</li>
<li><em>La Piena (Blackwater I)</em> by Michael McDowell</li>
<li><em>Matematica Rock</em> by Paolo Alessandrini</li>
<li><em>Decision-making for Software Development Teams</em> by Francesco Strazzullo</li>
<li><em>Less is more: sull‚Äôarte di non avere niente</em> by Salvatore La Porta</li>
<li><em>Indistractable</em> by Nir Eyal (my review <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/indistractable-book-summary/"  target="_blank" >here</a>)</li>
<li><em>Le coordinate della felicit√†</em> by Gianluca Gotto</li>
<li><em>The Elegant Universe</em> by Brian Greene</li>
<li><em>Developer Hegemony</em> by Erik Dietrich</li>
<li><em>Domain Driven Design Distilled</em> by Vaughn Vernon</li>
<li><em>The Master Key</em> by Togawa Masako</li>
<li><em>Show Your Work!</em> by Austin Kleon (currently writing a summary of it!)</li>
<li><em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em> by Michael C. Feathers</li>
<li><em>The Obstacle is The Way</em> by Ryan Holiday</li>
<li><em>The Arc</em> by Ben Oliver</li>
<li><em>Upheaval: How Nations Cope with Crisis and Change</em> by Jared Diamond</li>
<li><em>So good they can‚Äôt ignore you</em> by Cal Newport</li>
<li><em>Building Microservices</em> by Sam Newman</li>
<li><em>Thinking Better. The Art of the Shortcut</em> by Marcus Du Sautoy</li>
<li><em>Tokyo tutto l‚Äôanno</em> by Laura Imai Messina</li>
<li><em>Fooled by Randomness</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</li>
<li><em>Make Shift: Dispatches from the Post-Pandemic Future</em> edited by Gideon Lichfield</li>
<li><em><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Critica Portatile al Visual Design</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></em> (Portable Critique to Visual Design) by Riccardo Falcinelli</li>
</ul>
<p>And here‚Äôs a list of the books I didn‚Äôt finish‚Ä¶ I must say, they are less than last year, but it might be because I read less overall.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>LSD, my problem child</em> by Albert Hofmann</li>
<li><em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius (I try to go back to it sometimes, but I stopped reading it months ago)</li>
<li><em>Irriducibile</em> by Federico Faggin (really interesting, but also a bit criptic)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the list I can see that most of my readings are non-fiction (I read only 5/6 fiction books) and programming-related books. Usually, when I read I do it either to learn something or to get inspired. As I already wrote last year, I have the bad habit of not taking notes often enough, so I don‚Äôt recall much of what I read. I hope to get better next year‚Ä¶.</p>
<p>Also, next year I hope I‚Äôll read so much that putting a list here won‚Äôt have sense anymore üòõ</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>Last year I bought and moved to my home with my girlfriend and her cat. The only notable thing I did this year was to finally attach lamps to the walls (instead of letting the lightbulbs dangling üòÖ). I also bought some furniture and improved my home office (thanks Zupit for that üòõ).</p>
<p>A sad note before thinking about my goals for next year: in July, our cat Lucky passed away üò¢. He had been with my girlfriend for 8 years and with me for the last year and half. We discovered he had heart issues during the christmas holidays in 2022, and even though he got better during the winter and spring, in the summer he got worse and we had to let him go.</p>
<p>See you Lucky üò¢</p>

<h2 id="new-years-resolutions">New Year‚Äôs resolutions</h2>
<p>I don‚Äôt like setting goals at the end of the year. Christmas Holidays allow me to relax and dream of impossible goals and futures in which everything is perfect and goes according to plans, but reality is never like this.</p>
<p>Still‚Ä¶. let‚Äôs make some new year‚Äôs resolutions for 2024 üòÖ</p>
<p>For 2024 I have some goals in mind. Last year I wrote too much, so let‚Äôs keep it short.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write</strong> more regularly on the blog (every 2 weeks?) and more about programming (still keeping ‚Äújournal-style‚Äù posts)</li>
<li>More <strong>exercise</strong> (2 times a week instead of one) and getting in shape (85 kg or less)</li>
<li><strong>Speak</strong> somewhere! Even a small meetup or internal company talks is enough to start</li>
<li>Improve on the <strong>entire stack</strong> (my new job title is ‚ÄúFull-Stack developer‚Äù now, so I better start learning those damned frontend frameworks!)</li>
<li>(Again) Attend <strong>conferences</strong> and <strong>meetups</strong> like I did in 2023</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>That‚Äôs all! 2023 was great. I met new people, changed job and learned a lot.</p>
<p>I hope 2024 will be better, for me and also for you!</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi! üëã Welcome to a new post.</p>
<p>On October 19-21, I attended the SoCraTes (un)conference in Rimini. With over 90 people, we gathered to talk about software crafting, testing, and all related (and unrelated) stuff üòõ.</p>
<p>The event was fantastic! I met a lot of new people, gained insights into my current and future learning, and had some interesting (and crazy) discussions (such as discovering the niche of custom keyboards and firmware ü§©)!!!</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to give a brief summary of what an unconference is and the sessions I attended during the event.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-open-space">What is an Open Space?</h2>
<p>SoCraTes is a unique event because of its interesting format, called Open Space (or Unconference).</p>
<p>In a standard conference, everything is decided up-front: there is a call-for-papers, speakers and the agenda are decided beforehand, there are frontal sessions and workshops, etc. Basically, the attendees just need to come and watch what&rsquo;s offered by the conference organizing committee.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in an Open Space, the format, agenda, and topics discussed are decided by the participants during the event itself. This choice comes from the observation that, during a conference, the most inspiring and interesting stuff happens during coffee breaks and in the common areas. So why don&rsquo;t we transform the entire event into a big coffee break?</p>
<p>On every day of the Open Space, the participants gather to propose and decide the daily agenda: everyone can propose a talk, workshop, discussion, or any other type of activity (even a walking discussion on the beach üòé or a party game). After the proposals, it&rsquo;s time for the <strong>marketplace</strong>: everyone can ask the session organizer to move the session (to a different time and location) or to change/expand the topic. The important thing is that only the one who proposed the session can change it!</p>
<p>After the marketplace has ended and the agenda is ready, the unconference can start. During the event, there is only one rule to follow, called the &ldquo;rule of two feet&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not contributing or adding value to the session, you can move elsewhere freely.</p></blockquote>
<p>This rule is not confined to the pre-defined sessions. Participants can move between sessions, stay in common areas, or look for other people to start impromptu activities! That&rsquo;s the beauty of the open space format.</p>
<p>Given that they can freely move during the event, participants usually divide into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Butterflies: they like to move a lot and cross-pollinate the discussions.</li>
<li>Bumblebees: they stay in the same room for the entire duration of the session, bringing stability and continuity to the discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the rule of two feet generates four principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoever comes is the right people.</li>
<li>Whenever it starts is the right time.</li>
<li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could happen.</li>
<li>When it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s over.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rule of two feet and the four principles above allow the participants to express themselves in many ways and encourage collaboration and open discussions throughout the event. That&rsquo;s what brought me to attend it!</p>
<h2 id="my-experience-at-socrates-it-2023">My experience at SoCraTes-IT 2023</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief summary of my experience at SoCraTes 2023. I didn&rsquo;t take many notes and pictures, so most of the descriptions below might be incomplete or plain wrong. This is more of a journaling exercise for me.</p>
<p>Given this disclaimer, if you find any errors, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me (or open an issue/PR on my website <a href="https://github.com/marcobacis/marcobacis.github.io"  target="_blank" >repository</a> on GitHub üòõ).</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>The first day was just for networking and getting to know the other participants. I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, and then we had a happy hour, dinner, and a brief &ldquo;ice-breaker&rdquo; game.</p>
<p>We divided into groups, and each group had to introduce itself with a given description. My group had to decide if &ldquo;casual Friday&rdquo; was still a thing in the 2020s. We named our group &ldquo;Eat My Shorts&rdquo; and gave a short presentation on it. However, there was no interaction or any &ldquo;theatrical&rdquo; performance, and only one of us spoke, while other groups put on a show and moved around a lot. A reminder for next time: have more interaction between group members (try to talk üòÖ) and make the presentation funnier!!</p>
<p>After the ice breaker, I went to my room early because I hadn&rsquo;t been feeling well since the morning and needed to recharge for the next days.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>Friday was the first day of the Unconference!</p>
<p>We met in the hotel hall to have the first ‚Äúmarketplace‚Äù. Everyone interested/inspired attached a post-it with his/her session proposal. Then, we decided the rooms and time for each session.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a brief description on the sessions I was able to participate (even for a few minutes):</p>
<p><strong>Game AI and Montecarlo Tree Search - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteovaccari/"  target="_blank" >Matteo Vaccari</a></strong></p>
<p>In this session, Matteo taught us what a Monte Carlo search is and how it is useful for searching in very large decision trees. A perfect example of this was the game &ldquo;Commands&amp;Colors&rdquo; with some parts of the game having a million branch factor!</p>
<p>This was a preliminary test for his talk, which he gave a few days later at Codemotion. I wasn&rsquo;t able to see his entire session at SoCraTes, but I watched his talk at Codemotion and it was great!</p>
<p>For more information (and slides/code), visit <a href="https://matteo.vaccari.name/"  target="_blank" >Matteo&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Programmer‚Äôs Brain - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrctst/"  target="_blank" >Marco Testa</a></strong></p>
<p>In this session, Marco presented what he learned reading the book ‚Äú<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain"  target="_blank" >The Programmer‚Äôs Brain</a>‚Äù by Felienne Hermans.</p>
<p>The main concept we discussed was <strong>cognitive load</strong> and ways in which it affects software developers. The book provides many concepts and ways to reduce this cognitive load and make the code we develop easier to understand and remember. Many of the techniques have already been discussed in other books (e.g. clean code), but here they were related to cognitive load and all of its aspects.</p>
<p>The session was really interesting. Having attended a course on memory techniques some years ago I already knew some of the concepts presented, although not applied to software development.</p>
<p><strong>Stop fighting useless battles: automate code style, architecture compliance and refactoring - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robfrank/"  target="_blank" >Roberto Franchini</a></strong></p>
<p>Roberto gave this talk at the <a href="https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/"  target="_blank" >Working Software Conference</a> in June. I didn&rsquo;t see it at that time, but fortunately, he gave it again at SoCraTes! His talk was about ways to automate boring tasks that are quite important to keep a codebase clean among team members.</p>
<p>In particular, he presented:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pre-commit.com/"  target="_blank" >pre-commit</a>: a tool to boost commit hooks and CI pipelines, with various tasks and plugins from the community. He uses it to check certain rules, such as passwords and keys, fixing line endings, and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.archunit.org/"  target="_blank" >ArchUnit</a>: a tool to unit-test your architecture. It can be used to enforce separation between modules, check that the code doesn&rsquo;t import certain packages, and generally standardize and test the code architecture.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.openrewrite.org/"  target="_blank" >OpenRewrite</a>: allows for large-scale code refactoring, such as framework/API migrations, code cleanup, and other community-driven code transformations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about any of these tools, so it was a very inspiring talk!</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Trunk-Based Development - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabio-fortini/"  target="_blank" >Fabio Fortini</a></strong></p>
<p>After lunch, while everyone was feeling sleepy, Fabio ignited our fighting spirit by presenting a controversial argument: should we use trunk-based development in our projects?</p>
<p>He showed us a presentation he had given to his team in 2021 to convince them of the pros (without having used it before), and then gave his opinion after having done it for a few months.</p>
<p>The discussion was filled with arguments from both parties, and essentially Fabio stopped talking and (unintentionally) handed the stage over to the group.</p>
<p>It was an interesting discussion nonetheless: in the end, trunk-based development can be used as a teaching tool to help the team learn to work with small releases and continuously integrate into the main branch. Afterward, or if the team is already mature enough, small, frequently integrated branches can also be used (and are actually compatible with the trunk-based definition!).</p>
<p><strong>The Training Crafter - To read or not to read? - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiarabarbagianni/"  target="_blank" >Chiara Barbagianni</a></strong></p>
<p>The topic of the session was learning. Should we learn by reading or by doing, and can the two worlds work together?</p>
<p>Chiara gave a free-flowing presentation to our small group, starting with a survey and then writing on a whiteboard (and a lot of post-it notes) to decide how to merge the two opposing views.</p>
<p>She divided the board into 4 quadrants along 2 axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice (doing something practical, or reading about it?)</li>
<li>Taste (developing a taste for what you are learning, or doing it just for the money?)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end, Chiara presented how she&rsquo;s doing it in the <a href="https://handbook.agilelab.it/BookClub.html"  target="_blank" >Agile Lab Book Club</a>: instead of mandating all members to read a given chapter every time, the format is more generic. Every two weeks, the club curators propose a topic: members can explore it in any way (the recommended book, videos, blogs, anything) and post their learnings on a shared board. At the end of the two-week period, they share what they learned in a short training session.</p>
<p>I loved this session! The way it was kept was fantastic, and we were immersed in Chiara&rsquo;s mind throughout the entire duration of the discussion. That&rsquo;s exactly what I expected from an unconference.</p>

<p><strong>Monads for the Rest of us (in C#)  - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arialdomartini/"  target="_blank" >Arialdo Martini</a></strong></p>
<p>Even after studying it at the university, I still find it difficult to understand most functional programming concepts. But thanks to Arialdo, now I can understand it a bit more.</p>
<p>In his session, he started to implement monads (the most difficult concept in FP to me) in plain C#. Starting from function composition, passing through functors and implementing the IO monad, he tried to explain to the folks that we are how functional programming concepts map to an object oriented language.</p>
<p>His session was based on a series of posts <a href="https://arialdomartini.github.io/monads-for-the-rest-of-us"  target="_blank" >on his website</a>, that I will definitely try to follow to learn all there is about monads!</p>
<p><strong>Friday evening special: Oggetti a Teatro‚Äù (Objects on Stage) - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrctst/"  target="_blank" >Marco Testa</a></strong></p>
<p>Unlike many conferences, the party didn‚Äôt finish after dinner. Instead, there were 2 parallel sessions. One was a NIX installation party at the pub, while the other was a high-class evening at the theatre.</p>
<p>Marco wrote and gave life to a set of characters (I still remember the <em>Duke of Client</em>, the <em>Count of Receiver</em>, and <em>Invoker the spy</em>!) that together and with their actions formed the perfect description of the Command Pattern. He basically wrote the script of a design pattern, highlighting the behaviour of the different component and their scope. Also, the story was pretty engaging!</p>
<p>Even if short, the <em>opera</em> was well received by the public, and I think it would be a great way to explain design patterns in a memorable way.</p>
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p>Second day of Unconference. We started immediately with the session proposals and marketplace, as there was less time than Friday (the event finished at 17).</p>

<p><strong><del>Coping</del>/Coding with Product - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brando/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Brandolini</a></strong></p>
<p>In this session, Alberto continued the discussion started on friday (which unfortunately I didn‚Äôt attend‚Ä¶) on how developers can work together with the product/business side without headaches or creating ‚Äúdirty‚Äù code.</p>
<p>He started by re-defining technical debt (which he deemed a wrong analogy) with its opposite, <strong>Design Integrity</strong>: ‚Äúhow much the current codebase fits its purpose‚Äù or how much the code is ready for the next change.</p>
<p>He went on explaining how product side is based on ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù, as the roadmap is not as clearly defined as we developers would like the code to be. How can we make the two ends meet? Our work as technical people is to work on ‚Äúsafe bets‚Äù from a good design to another good design, without reducing the design integrity.</p>
<p>The group went on a discussion on changes of which I didn‚Äôt take note, so writing it here would be useless.</p>
<p>In the end, the core idea is that developers should work together with product to define different ‚Äúpurposes‚Äù (either core or not to the business) and isolate these choices in distinct bounded contexts and components, to reduce the possible damage given by continuous product experiments.</p>
<p>This is not a set process, but can evolve based on the product (e.g. a context might get split in multiple services, or multiple services merged because they follow the same purpose‚Ä¶).</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, Alberto wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@ziobrando/from-technical-debt-to-design-integrity-48e7056b6776"  target="_blank" >post</a> in which he explains these concepts in a much cleaner way than me üòÖ</p>
<p><strong>Refactoring with CQRS (without events) - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucagiovenzana/"  target="_blank" >Luca Giovenzana</a></strong></p>
<p>Luca showed how they refactored the backend for their startup (<a href="https://golee.it/"  target="_blank" >golee</a>) using CQRS, but without using event sourcing as everyone doing CQRS is doing right now. Basically, the team at golee migrated some functionality to the new, greenfield codebase which was used as <em>write model</em>, while keeping the old (legacy) code as <em>read model</em> and as a backup, by writing to it using a hook.</p>
<p>By keeping the system simple (no events and event sourcing) they were able to keep both systems running, without impacting on their ability to extend it and improving performances.</p>
<p>His session was a nice look at how to take tradeoffs, which are essential when running a startup!</p>
<p><strong>Create a Macropad for fun!! - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli/"  target="_blank" >Gianni Bombelli</a></strong></p>
<p>During the breaks and dinners on thursday and friday I was introduced to the world of custom keyboards. It‚Äôs a world full of crazy people talking about layouts, layers and keys. When Gianni put a post-it named ‚ÄúCreate a macropad for FUN!‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt resist.</p>
<p>In his session, he showed us his ‚Äúhobby‚Äù project, a custom mechanical macropad to help him during training sessions, in which he uses a graphics tablet and might need some ready-to-use shortcuts (e.g. to delete the latest line drawn, to open an application, to use git).</p>
<p>His session was a deep-dive in how to build a custom keyboard, from the PCB up to the customisation with QMK and a bit of C programming. Now I really want a custom macropad!! I‚Äôll wait for the ‚ÄúBomboPad‚Äù to enter the market üòõ</p>
<p><strong>Orthogonality of TDD, SOLID, FP - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteobaglini/"  target="_blank" >Matteo Baglini</a></strong></p>
<p>In his session, Matteo showed us how TDD, SOLID principles and Functional Programming are related. He implemented the password validator kata, doing small steps by following TDD and doing it in a functional way.</p>
<p>I came into the session while it was already started so I lost most of the context. Fortunately, Matteo shared the <a href="https://github.com/matteobaglini/orthogonality-socrates-it-2023"  target="_blank" >repo</a> containing the kata implementation, with every small step of the red-green-refactor process explained in separate commits! A great way to visualize TDD in action.</p>
<p><strong>PKMS/Note Taking - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagasantagostino/"  target="_blank" >Jaga Santagostino</a></strong></p>
<p>The final session I attended was an open discussion about Obsidian and Personal Knowledge Management Systems (PKMS) in general.</p>
<p>Jaga showed us the many features in Obsidian and tried to compare it with another famous PKMS application, Notion.</p>
<p>While presenting, other participants asked questions and gave their opinions. For example I learned about another tool, called logseq, which is quite similar to obsidian.</p>
<p>In the end I gave obsidian a try. I actually used it to take notes during the unconference, and to take notes at the Codemotion conference the week later. I now found out how to share my notes with git, so from now on I‚Äôll try to use it instead of Notion! It‚Äôs local-first paradigm is very useful when working offline, and the backlinks and graph view are really interesting and allow to link ideas together. Also, is definitely faster than notion üòÖ.</p>
<p>Thanks Jaga for this discovery!</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End!</h2>
<p>SoCraTes was a great event! I met new people, learned a lot and had fun, the perfect combination    for a conference.</p>
<p>I came home with a lot of new concepts, tools and inspiration, and I cannot wait for the next event like this (which will be the <a href="https://www.agileday.it/"  target="_blank" >2023 Agile Day</a> Unconference, on Nov. 17 üòõ).</p>
<p>As always, thanks for all the participants, to the sponsors, organizer and everyone involved. The most meaningful connections happen in a free and creative environment, and that‚Äôs exactly what SoCraTes is.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this long and boring summary, I hope to have shown (even a bit) all I saw and felt during the event. If you find anything to correct (e.g. about your session, about my grammar, or if I forgot something) just contact me via mail or linkedin, or open an issue on this website repository on github.</p>
<p>As always, see you next time!</p>
