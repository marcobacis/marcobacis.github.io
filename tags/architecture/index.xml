This post is a short summary (with personal notes and opinions here and there) of the XPUGBg (Bergamo’s eXtreme Programming User Group) meetup I attended in March.
Actually, it’s just a bunch of notes and ideas connected together by my imagination and opinions 😂 (as I already did here and here).
This month&amp;rsquo;s talk was titled “The Actor Model and why an XP programmer should know it” by Emanuele DelBono.</description></item><item><title>A Case for Outside-In Design: Sandro Mancuso @ Tech Talks by eDreams ODIGEO</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/outside-in-design-edreams-meetup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 22:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/outside-in-design-edreams-meetup/</guid><description>Hi 👋 and welcome to a new post!
In my 2022 review, I said that one of my goals for 2023 was to participate more in communities (meetups, conferences and so on). Well, as a first step to achieving that goal, I attended a meetup hosted by eDreams ODIGEO (here) on January 24th.
For the inauguration of their Milan Hub, eDreams hosted Sandro Mancuso for his talk “A Case for Outside-In Design”, in which he proposes a set of practices and techniques to make business and technology meet when designing and extending a system.</description></item><item><title>My Experience at the Italian Agile Days 2022: Talks and Reflections</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-italian-agile-days/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-italian-agile-days/</guid><description>Hi 👋
Today’s post is about my experience at the Italian Agile Days 2022, which I attended in October 2022. I know, it’s way too late to write this, but I still think that remembering the talks I watched will be useful for others 😃.
The Italian Agile Days is a 2-day free conference held in a different city every year, in which people interested in agile practices (programmers and business people alike) gather to talk about agile and development practices.</description></item></channel></rss>
