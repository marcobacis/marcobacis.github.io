Todayâ€™s post is about my experience at the Italian Agile Days 2022, which I attended in October 2022. I know, itâ€™s way too late to write this, but I still think that remembering the talks I watched will be useful for others ðŸ˜ƒ.
The Italian Agile Days is a 2-day free conference held in a different city every year, in which people interested in agile practices (programmers and business people alike) gather to talk about agile and development practices.</description></item></channel></rss>
