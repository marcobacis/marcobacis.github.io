          <p>Hi 👋  welcome to the usual end-of-year recap on the blog! This is the 4th year in a row I manage to write (here are <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2022-a-review/"  target="_blank" >the</a> <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2023-review/"  target="_blank" >older</a> <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2024-review/"  target="_blank" >posts</a>).</p>
<p>Even though I don&rsquo;t write much on the blog, I take the time to reflect on the past year and write a free-form post. Feel free to skip it: it&rsquo;s mostly a self-retrospective.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<h2 id="2025-goals-review">2025 Goals Review</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a brief review of the goals I set for myself for 2025. This time, I managed to miss most of them 😎. Not so great</p>
<h4 id="-write-more">❌ Write more</h4>
<p>Every year I promise to myself to write more on the blog, and every time I fall short on the goal.</p>
<p>Last year I set a goal to write &ldquo;more freely&rdquo; on the blog, without caring about judgement or having something interesting to say. But by saying that, I actually did worse than before!</p>
<p>In 2025 I wrote 5 posts (including this one), roughly one every 3 months&hellip; definitely not what I had in mind.</p>
<p>If I must save something, then I did make it easier to publish on the blog by removing the <em>hero</em> image from the posts 😂 and making it minimal. I thought choosing the picture was the issue, when in reality finding the courage to hit &ldquo;publish&rdquo; was the real killer.</p>
<h4 id="-more-exercise">✅ More exercise</h4>
<p>Following the trend from 2024, I kept exercising throughout the year. What helped me keep consistent was going once a week to a personal trainer, and 1-2 times to a public gym.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t lose weight (actually, I put on 4 kg), but I didn&rsquo;t gain more. Considering how I eat, it&rsquo;s a success!</p>
<h4 id="-contribute-to-open-source">❌ Contribute to Open Source</h4>
<p>Another goal missed. This time, the official excuse is that I didn&rsquo;t find any project I liked enough to put my effort in . I started a small project as exercise (a redis clone in rust) but  it&rsquo;s there with the big pile of unfinished projects on my github.</p>
<p>Entering the Open Source world is seen as &ldquo;the thing to do&rdquo; to become a proper software engineer. But the thing is&hellip;. I actually like what I do for work 😅 I&rsquo;d like to find some bugs or feature I need in what I use daily (e.g. .NET or Angular) but usually I just don&rsquo;t find that need.</p>
<h4 id="-publish-a-videotalk">❌ Publish a Video/Talk</h4>
<p>The end of 2024 started strong, with 7 videos done while solving Advent of Code puzzles. Well&hellip;. that was it 😅 I didn&rsquo;t publish anything else on youtube, or propose any talk at conferences or meetups.</p>
<p>Same as the blog, the fear of judgement and my low confidence (in addition to a healthy dose of lazyness) stopped me from publishing anything.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>2025 marked my second year at <a href="https://www.zupit.it/"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>, and also my second full year working remotely! In 2024 I transitioned from commuting to staying in my pajamas, and never went back. Working remotely has got me a ton of free time, health and peacefullness.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are challenges. When working remotely, you have to find your rythm: no commute, no office means no proper &ldquo;end-of-workday&rdquo; ritual and no tranisition between work and not-work. I had to learn how to divide the two properly, using lunch and the gym as transitions (thanks to working only until 2PM!!). I can count on my hand the times I went to the office this year, but each time it was a refreshing event: I either came to attend some meetups in Trento, or to see my teammates and other colleagues. After two years, I can say: I miss the office.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go back soon: working remotely is a better choice both in terms of work-life balance and of general health (less traffic, less train delays, less pollution). But sometimes I wonder how it would be like to work in an office with the same team I have now. For sure, the dynamics would be wildly different (for example, I&rsquo;m way more annoying in person than on slack!).</p>
<p>Apart from remote working, 2025 brought some new projects and roles. Being a small consultancy agency, in Zupit we both start new projects, and inherit legacy code. This year I managed to do both. We started 3 new projects (and one of them could become the first <em>product</em> sold by the company, in addition to consultancy work) and received and were able to improve and ship a legacy project (we went from no pipelines, to go from commit to prod in minutes!).</p>
<p>With these projects, I learned new stuff both for back-end (e.g. stripe integration, Business Central APIs and how to properly write batch synchronization jobs) and frontend projects (e.g. signals in angular 19/20).</p>
<p>Lastly, this year our tech lead changed job mid-year, and one of our teammates rose to the challenge and got promoted. I watched from the side (I still want to code for some time, and not increase the amount of meetings and calls too much), but after his promotion I got to help him as <em>&ldquo;Deputy&rdquo;</em>. This meant more analysis, firefighting and playing with github actions and production environments, with casual &ldquo;<em>interim-tech-lead</em>&rdquo; moments throughout the year.</p>
<p>What will 2026 bring? I hope I&rsquo;ll get better at proposing technical solutions (mainly to the team, as I talk to customers only after pre-analysis by PO and TL) and mentoring the team, all while improving my craft. I&rsquo;ll probably need to learn mobile development too&hellip;. but that&rsquo;s for next year&rsquo;s me to handle.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say on the topic. Last year I wrote 9 posts, while this year I wrote an all-time-low of 4 posts (+ this one).</p>
<p>The year started strong: I read <em>Writing for Developers</em>, a book centered around the importance of keeping a technical blog, along with resources and tips to write more and better. I read it, used the advice for my first 2025 post, and then forgot everything.</p>
<p>The thing is&hellip;every tool and resource I add to my inventory, ends up making the act of writing&hellip; <em>heavy</em>. The book was fantastic, but it gave me even more things to check when reviewing a post. Each article I read adds to the <em>shoulds</em> of writing: should write more, should collect ideas, should journal&hellip;too many obligations!</p>
<p>I think writing should be the expression of something I need&hellip;and most of the times, I don&rsquo;t need anything.</p>
<p>The goal for 2026 is thus <em>spontaneity</em>: writing about whatever I want, in whatever length it comes out, and whatever format.</p>
<p>It will still be difficult (and the current year have shown it&hellip;same goal, and no writing), but I hope the new year will bring some inspiration. Most of the time fear of judgement stops me from writing what I learn and my opinions on it&hellip;no more!</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>This year I read a bit more than in 2024 (26 books), but still less than at my peak (in 2020-2022).</p>
<p>This shows that the declining trend which started in 2023 is continuing, reducing my reading time in favour of the smartphone. Since working from home, my attention span got lower, abused by short-form videos (that you cannot watch on a train without headphones or stable connection, but can definitely do while eating at home or resting on the sofa) and by youtube on my television.</p>
<p>BTW, here&rsquo;s the list of books I read this year (courtesy of my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22830084-marco-bacis"  target="_blank" >goodreads profile</a>):
<em>(Disclaimer: didn&rsquo;t want to translate the titles, so if I read the book in italian the title will also be in italian)</em></p>
<ul>

<li><em>Cecità</em> by José Saramago</li>
<li><em>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages</em> by Bruce A. Tate</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to read more technical books this year, in part thanks to the XPUG (eXtreme Programming User Group) Bergamo with their <em>book club</em>. We met every week to discuss a chapter from a book, either talking or doing the exercises.</p>
<p>For example, in 2025 we read</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Learning Domain-Driven Design</em> by Vlad Khononov</li>
<li><em>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages</em> by Bruce A. Tate</li>
</ul>
<p>it might not seem much, but we explored these books in ways I would have never done alone: nitpicking every definition and explanation, providing examples, real-life experiences and exercising on every chapter! Definitely a great way to study a technical book.</p>
<p>For next year, the first book we&rsquo;re going to read will be <em>Clean Architecture</em>. A &ldquo;solid&rdquo; re-read of SOLID principles and architecture is needed, given that I read this book 5 years ago (at a time when I didn&rsquo;t think much about architecture, just making the code work!).</p>
<p>You can find XPUGBg on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/xpug-bergamo/"  target="_blank" >LinkedIn</a> or luma (for the <a href="https://luma.com/xpug-bg-book-club"  target="_blank" >book club</a> and the <a href="https://luma.com/calendar/cal-018qZ28z0TiA2VA"  target="_blank" >meetup</a> calendars)</p>
<h2 id="communities">Communities</h2>
<p>Participating in communities and events is a great way to learn, meet new people and also have fun in the process.
I won&rsquo;t list all the meetups and groups I attended this year, just a small list of the conferences I attended:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/"  target="_blank" >FOSDEM 2025</a></li>
<li>Polenta &amp; Deploy unconference - (see the <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2024-polenta-and-deploy/"  target="_blank" >post</a> from last year edition)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.webdayconf.it/2025"  target="_blank" >Web Day 2025</a></li>
<li>Polenta, Sardine &amp; Deploy unconference (same vibes as Polenta&amp;Deploy, different protein on the polenta!)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/"  target="_blank" >Working Software Conference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.socrates-conference.it/"  target="_blank" >SoCraTes 2025</a> - also wrote a <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2025-socrates/"  target="_blank" >post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://conferences.codemotion.com/milan2025/"  target="_blank" >Codemotion Milan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rustlab.it/"  target="_blank" >RustLab</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.updateconference.net/"  target="_blank" >Update Conference Prague</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most active periods of 2025 have been the beginning (February-April) with FOSDEM and two unconferences, and a tour-de-force in October/November, starting with SoCraTes and ending in Prague for Update Conference.</p>
<p>My goal for conferences and meetups is to learn at least a new concept, or meet a new person in each event. Even if I don&rsquo;t watch all talks, I can still say that an event is worth it if I can enjoy a discussion with new people, or learn from someone I already know!</p>
<p>As I already said in the blog, I think the best event a programmer can attend is the unconference: a small and safe space in which everyone can learn and show what he learned. An unconference allows to see stuff you don&rsquo;t usually see in standard conferences, and also provides a place to share your knowledge and opinions without convincing a committee, or being a sponsor 😏.</p>
<p>So next year, I plan to attend mostly unconferences, and less conferences.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h2>
<p>Not much has happened in 2025. I got married in november 2024, so this marks our first anniversary 🥰. We were already living together, so there was no abrupt change in how I live.</p>
<p>What will definitely change how I live is in the making, and will arrive in April&hellip;I&rsquo;m going to be a father! it will be a challenge for sure.</p>
<p>In 2025 we also got a new cat. She&rsquo;s younger than lucky (she&rsquo;s 4/5 years old) and likes to attack whenever I pet her. So cute.</p>
<h2 id="2026-goals">2026 Goals</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for the &ldquo;Marco dreams up impossible goals to set for next year&rdquo; section!
Instead of declaring goals and then not reaching them, this time I&rsquo;d like to propose a single theme I want to follow:</p>
<p><strong>Improve &amp; Share</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it? Yes.</p>
<p>Improving means learning (by reading, taking courses/conferences/whatever) and taking actions upon what I learn. Sharing means losing the fear of judgement and accepting that what I learn can be shared to others without doubting myself every time.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? Reading more, writing more and (maybe) sharing what I learn (on the blog, on youtube, on github? who knows).</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all! 2025 was a nice year: I met new people, learned a lot and improved on many fronts.</p>
<p>I still wish I had done a bit more on the blog and outside of it, but I cannot change what happened! We can only work towards our future, and learn to watch back without judgement.</p>
<p>With this philosophycal ending, I say goodbye to you, my reader.</p>
<p>Happy 2026, and see you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi 👋 and welcome to the usual end-of-year recap! Right before Christmas, I take some time to reflect on the year that has passed, and write some observations here on the blog (<a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2022-a-review/"  target="_blank" >2022</a>, <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2023-review/"  target="_blank" >2023</a>).</p>
<p>This time it&rsquo;s not different, so let&rsquo;s start!</p>
<h2 id="2024-goals-review">2024 Goals Review</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a brief review of the goals I set for myself for 2024:</p>
<h4 id="-write-more">❌ Write more</h4>
<p>The first goal I set for 2024 was to write more on this blog, and in particular to focus more on programming (less journals and reviews, more code)!</p>
<p>In 2024, I wrote 9 post&hellip;less than 2023! Definitely didn&rsquo;t reach the &ldquo;1 post every two weeks&rdquo; I set as goal at the beginning of 2024.</p>
<h4 id="-exercise">✅ Exercise</h4>
<p>This year I focused more on exercising than last year. I regularly (2 times a week) went to a gym (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/performa_bg/"  target="_blank" >@performa</a>), lost 5kg and in general led a healthier lifestyle than before. I didn&rsquo;t reach 85kg or less yet, but I still think this is a win!</p>
<p>For next year, I will focus more on health, maybe increasing my gym attendance to 3 times a week + a short run once in a while (to get some fresh air instead of the sweaty one at the gym 😅).</p>
<h4 id="-speak-somewhere">❌ Speak somewhere</h4>
<p>In 2023 I attended a lot of conferences and meetups. This inspired me to set a goal for 2024 to &ldquo;speak somewhere&rdquo;&hellip; which I didn&rsquo;t. Same thing as taking care of the blog, it takes creativity and constant work to keep a habit of writing or speaking, and I simply didn&rsquo;t put effort into this.</p>
<p>I hope this will change in 2025! I still have no ideas for a talk, but I hope that putting more effort into the blog will bring some ideas for talks too! I also plan on attending more &ldquo;unconferece&rdquo;-style events in order to practice speaking, even without an agenda or a talk ready.</p>
<h4 id="-learn-across-the-stack">✅ Learn across the stack</h4>
<p>I definitely learnt a lot in 2024. Spoiler: I set this goal right after starting my new job at <a href="https://www.zupit.it/"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>, so I knew there will be learning involved.</p>
<p>In 2024, I extended my knowledge of C#/.NET and learned to work on the frontend too, with Angular. I also refreshed my knowledge of CSS (more on that on a blog post, maybe&hellip;) and learned a bit of mobile development with flutter (the project got canceled before starting, but I still prepared with a course on Dart and Flutter 😁).</p>
<h4 id="-attend-conferences-and-meetups">✅ Attend conferences and meetups</h4>
<p>Attending conferences and meetups was an easy goal I set for myself for 2024 to force me to get out of the house and meet people. And it worked 😅! I attended a lot of events (maybe less than 2023, but still more than I expected). More on that later.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Time for a proper review of 2024! Let&rsquo;s start from work.</p>
<p>I left <a href="https://e-novia.it/"  target="_blank" >e-Novia</a> in December 2023. Even if the job was interesting and involved a lot of learning across the entire stack (from firmware to web and even gaming) I wasn&rsquo;t ok with the policy around remote working and the overall &ldquo;slowness&rdquo; of the projects. We treated startups like standard consulting customers, with waterfall-like planning and a lot of rigidity. I was looking for a more &ldquo;agile&rdquo; company.</p>
<p>I looked for alternatives, and found <a href="https://zupit.it"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>, a small consultancy from Trento focused on learning, continuous improvement and performance. The biggest perk that attracted me was Zupit part-time policy 😏: 30 hours/week and remote, what could I ask more? I could focus my newly-freed time on learning, improving myself and so on.</p>
<p>And I have a lot of free time now! Between the 10 hours of work saved, and the many more hours saved from commute (I was commuting daily, about 3 and half hours each day&hellip;) I have a lot of time to relax, study and have fun.</p>
<p>I invested part of this free time to improve myself. In 2023 I started going to the gym on saturday morning (the only time I could). In 2024 I started going 2 times a week in the afternoon, to save time on the weekend and stay with my family. I also plan to increase to 3 times a week 😎.</p>
<p>Another thing that I do with this time is learn. While before I would have studied during the commute or in the evening, now I have time to study in the afternoon. Right after entering Zupit I studied Angular, to catch up with what the team was using. I had never used the framework, so I had a lot to learn. After that, I dabbled a bit with Flutter, even I I still hadn&rsquo;t used it at work. Now, I have a list of technical books I want to read, along with keeping my Rust knowledge up-to-date, even if I might not use it for work right now.</p>
<p>Finally, the last thing I do with this time is&hellip;.relax. Not everything in life has to be done for a purpose, and I reject the idea that we should be all working all the time. I am definitely not competitive (in fact, I was never successful at sports), so sometimes I take time to relax by reading a good book, taking walks around the town (I discovered parks I didn&rsquo;t know existed) and doing things slower. Since I left my job in Milan, I noticed I&rsquo;ve become more calm and even slower in my movements and thoughts!!</p>
<p>In addition to working less, Zupit advocates for continuous improvement and learning. We work 6 hours a day, but to compensate that we need to be more productive and mindful during that time. During 2024, I learned how to focus more during work hours, and improved my productivity both because of this, and also thanks to the better developer experience we have in Zupit. (Most of) projects follow a standard format, we use the latest tools (e.g. jetbrains suite before it was free, chatgpt, copilot) and have a seamless deployment experience (mostly thanks to our Tech Leads and volunteers which keep the pipelines running 🥰).</p>
<p>I must say, I miss the office a bit. Trento is not so far from my hometown, but it&rsquo;s still more than 2 hours by car each way. In my previous job I advocated for full-remote work, but now this personal belief is starting to crack. Working alone in a room is not the same than working with others IRL, even with low-latency video calls and messages. Whenever I can, I look forward meeting with the team in person, but I think it doesn&rsquo;t happen often enough because of the cost this presents (for me, and for the company&hellip;hotels aren&rsquo;t free!).</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>My goal for 2024 was to write at least 20 posts, or even better to begin posting every two weeks. I definitely didn&rsquo;t reach that goal 😅.</p>
<p>This year I published 9 posts (+ this one you are reading):</p>

</ul>
<p>Two of them (IAD 2023 and &ldquo;Show your work&rdquo;) were actually written in part in 2023, so this brings the gran total to 7 new posts written in 2024&hellip;less than once a month!!</p>
<p>There are a lot of <del>excuses</del> reasons to explain why I didn&rsquo;t stay consistent during 2024: lack of ideas, impostor syndrome, personal committments (more on that in the <a href="#personal" >last section</a>). I think the most obvious reason is that I didn&rsquo;t put enough effort in this blog. I definitely had time to write (see the <a href="#work" >previous</a> section), but didn&rsquo;t find what I was doing at work interesting enough to be published, or didn&rsquo;t try to make it more interesting 😅.</p>
<p>I still had fun writing these posts. The three-part series on writing a load balancer in rust also landed on the <a href="https://this-week-in-rust.org/"  target="_blank" >This Week in Rust</a> newsletter (on <a href="https://www.marcoieni.com/"  target="_blank" >Marco Ieni</a>&rsquo;s advice, he forced me to propose the posts!). I really liked writing the load balancer and explaining in detail how I implemented it. It also was a lot of work! I kept changing the load balancer code while writing the posts. In the end, writing forced me to learn more about async Rust and to keep my code clean and clear for the audience, which is exactly why I think writing is the best way to learn a new concept.</p>
<p>Now, some spoiler for 2025: I just bought the book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/writing-for-developers"  target="_blank" >Writing for Developers</a>&rdquo; by Piotr Sarna and Cynthia Dunlop. I plan to read this right at the beginning of the year, to inspire me and get some tips and tricks on how to find post ideas and executing on them.</p>
<p>I also just finished reading <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/"  target="_blank" >Learning Domain-Driven Design</a> by Vlad Khononov, and plan to write a couple of posts with my summary (it will force me to re-read the book and get more out of it).</p>
<p>Finally, I plan to attend more conferences this year (see next <a href="#communities" >section</a>) and will probably write about my experience there 😉.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>This year I read significantly less than in 2023 (23 books instead of 28). This continues the trend from 2022 (32 -&gt; 28 -&gt; 23).</p>
<p>Since working remotely I noticed I am reading less books, and instead have increased my screen time. I suppose that commuting forced me to read rather than watch videos (both for the sound - the train can be very noisy - and for the bad connectivity in some areas). I hope to reverse this trend, resist the TV and smartphone and get back to reading more books next year!</p>
<p>BTW, here&rsquo;s the list of books I read this year (courtesy of my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22830084-marco-bacis"  target="_blank" >goodreads profile</a>):
<em>(Disclaimer: didn&rsquo;t want to translate the titles, so if I read the book in italian the title will also be in italian)</em></p>

<li><em>Lezioni di Fiducia per diffidenti</em> by Olga Chiaia</li>
<li><em>Terraform: Up and Running</em> by Yevgeniy Brikman</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for not finishing them, and most of all the book from Uberto (<em>From Objects to Functions</em>): I really enjoyed following the first chapters. Following along the book with the code (copying it) was not straightforward, and also my lack of knowledge in kotlin didn&rsquo;t help 😅. I still plan to read it in 2025, so you&rsquo;ll find it in the &ldquo;read&rdquo; list next year!</p>
<h2 id="communities">Communities</h2>
<p>This year I continued the trend started in 2023 of going to conferences and meetups near me. I love participating in these events, as they allow to both keep updated on new technologies and to meet new people and old friends.</p>
<p>Thanks to Zupit, this year I was also able to attend an international conference on .NET (spoiler: I already bought the ticket for next year 😝). It was a great way to breathe some international air, meet the Prague .NET community and update my knowledge of .NET and related stuff. I also <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2024-update-conference/"  target="_blank" >wrote</a> about the conference.</p>
<p>As usual, here&rsquo;s the list of conferences and meetups I attended in 2024
Conferences (and unconferences):</p>

</ul>
<p>Meetups:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/ugidotnet/"  target="_blank" >.NET Italian User Group</a> (UGIdotNet)</li>
</ul>
<p>A nice addition to the list of meetups is the XPUG groups in Milan and Trento: while Milan is a destination near me, the Trento group was created this year, and I was able to participate to their meetups and also go the office the day before/after. Two birds with a stone!</p>
<p>For next year, I plan to attend at least the same events as 2024, with the addition of FOSDEM (as I did in <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/2023-my-fosdem-experience/"  target="_blank" >2023</a>) and other Unconferences (like <a href="https://www.socrates-conference.it/"  target="_blank" >SoCraTes</a>), which I didn&rsquo;t attend this time because I was in another continent (🇯🇵, see below).</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h2>
<p>If 2023 was marked by a sad news (Lucky 😭), 2024 had a really positive event.</p>
<p>In December 2023, given my new free time, I took some time to find a nice ring. In February, I bit the bullet and finally proposed to my girlfriend, so&hellip;we got married in October 💍!</p>

<p>Right after the wedding, we departed for a 3 week trip to Japan. I had already been there in 2023, but it was nothing compared to our honeymoon! We visited Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo with short trips to Nagoya (where we visited my favorite place: the <a href="https://museum.jr-central.co.jp/en/"  target="_blank" >Japan Rail Museum</a>!!), Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, Takayama and Hakone (a fantastic hot spring area, with a terrible traffic).</p>
<p>Japan was wonderful, and I cannot wait to go there again 😍</p>

<h2 id="2025-goals">2025 Goals</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for the &ldquo;Marco dreams up impossible goals to set for next year&rdquo; section!
After careful considerations, here they are:</p>
<h4 id="write-more">Write more</h4>
<p>Last year I made a goal of writing every two weeks on this blog. This time I won&rsquo;t commit to a specific cadence. However, the goal is to write more freely on the blog, without listening too much to the impostor living in my brain.</p>
<p>Is the content original/advanced/deep enough? Will someone care? Will I get any reads? Am I exposing how smart I am, how much I know?</p>
<p>These are all thoughts and questions that I will have to ignore while writing. Simple! Whenever I see something interesting, I&rsquo;ll write here, even if it ends up being a 3-lines post.</p>
<h4 id="more-exercise">More exercise</h4>
<p>This year I was able to exercise two times a week by going to a personal trainer. Time to take off the training wheels and subscribe to a public gym!</p>
<p>The goal is to exercise at least 3 times a week, either with the personal trainer or without. Also, I should lose some fat, getting to around 80kgs&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="contribute-to-open-source">Contribute to Open Source</h4>
<p>Last year I attended the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-Saturday-Milano/"  target="_blank" >Open Source Saturday Milano</a> event to force me to contribute to any OS project. I did it, but with a lot of hand-holding and help from the folks there. Also, I didn&rsquo;t continue contributing to the projects I saw there.</p>
<p>For 2025 this needs to change. Contributing to Open Source is a great way to give back something to the community, to learn new technology and in general to have fun. I hope to find at least one project and actively contribute to it!</p>
<h4 id="publish-a-videotalk">Publish a Video/Talk</h4>
<p>This is the third time I promise to create more content, so it better be the last one I promise, and the first time I actually deliver.</p>
<p>In December I tried live-streaming while solving some Advent Of Code challenges (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@marcobacis-dev"  target="_blank" >here</a> is the channel). The first time I was anxious and did a lot of errors, while the following days were easier.</p>
<p>Live-streaming is an easy way to show myself in public without too much background work (such as editing). The goal for 2025 is to keep streaming (e.g. try solving other challenges, maybe streaming while contributing to a project or learning a new technology). This fits with the <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public"  target="_blank" >Learn in Public</a> goal I had two years ago.</p>
<p>Another evergreen goal is to give a talk somewhere 😅 we&rsquo;ll see how that goes, as I fist need to find something interesting to talk about (can you hear the impostor talking?).</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all! 2024 was great. I learned a lot, met new people, traveled and also had one the most important moments in my life.</p>
<p>I hope 2025 will be even better, so let&rsquo;s start it with a smile and a lot of good intentions (not forgetting the effort and work to make it happen)!!</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>
