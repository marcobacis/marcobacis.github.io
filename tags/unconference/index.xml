<h2 id="ice-breaker">Ice Breaker</h2>
<p>The unconference started strong on the evening before. Upon arrival, the bar was filled with canvases. Each one had a title (e.g., &ldquo;your real opinion about agile,&rdquo; &ldquo;the first thing you&rsquo;d outlaw in software if you magically became a benevolent dictator tomorrow&rdquo;), some post-its, and markers. By moving around the room, you could write and discuss your opinions on the subjects. I think it was a great ice breaker, a nice diversion from last year&rsquo;s format (which was way more interactive and not suited to a group of programmers üòÇ).</p>

<p>The event started out great, with Cosimo showing us how to transform imperative TypeScript code into a functional style.</p>
<p>He first showed the kata: an image resize program. The program was fairly simple, but he wanted to use functional programming to achieve the same outcome, all without rewriting it from scratch. He showed us that this is possible using the Effect TypeScript library.</p>
<p><a href="https://effect.website/"  target="_blank" >Effect</a> is a TypeScript library for building composable applications. It provides a lot of building blocks, but its most useful application for this kata was the possibility of mixing functional and imperative code, so that we could transform the code one piece at a time. Effect provides two ways to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://effect.website/docs/getting-started/using-generators/"  target="_blank" >generators</a></li>
<li><a href="https://effect.website/docs/getting-started/building-pipelines/"  target="_blank" >pipelines</a> (very similar to reactive programming libraries such as RxJS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most interesting feature of Effect (and in general of functional programming languages) is that of <em>lazy evaluation</em>. All we were doing was defining the computation one block at a time, but without running the actual code&hellip; all operations were delayed until the last possible moment (when they were applied). Pretty neat.</p>
<p>The kata can be found <a href="https://github.com/devmatteini/imperative-to-effect-kata"  target="_blank" >here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="monads-in-bash---gianni">Monads in Bash - <a href="https://github.com/bombo82"  target="_blank" >Gianni</a></h3>
<p>Continuing the theme of functional programming, Gianni wanted to understand Monads (I still don&rsquo;t know exactly how they work) by reimplementing them in a language he knew.</p>
<p>Kotlin? Nah, it already has functional constructs.</p>
<p>Go? No, if he got serious, he could also have success in that.</p>
<p>What language did he choose in the end&hellip; bash!!!</p>
<p>He showed us how he implemented the <code>Maybe</code> construct (which indicates either a value or the absence of it) and the <code>map</code> method. The work was filled with tiny hacks (e.g., hardcoded strings to define <code>Nothing</code> and using pipes to represent list elements) but nonetheless very cool!! He cleverly used side effects (the only way to work effectively with bash) to simulate functional constructs in an otherwise very imperative language.</p>
<p>It has a lot of potential.</p>

<p>Coming down from the heights of functional programming, I wanted something closer to the hardware&hellip; and what better opportunity than watching a Gameboy emulator written in Rust?</p>
<p>Luca described all the nuances and details that go into implementing a hardware emulator. It was not a Rust talk (even if he used it to learn), but a deep dive into how crazy hardware architecture was in the 80s/90s.</p>
<p>The thing that was craziest for me was graphics management. First, graphics are managed with 3 different constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li>background</li>
<li>window</li>
<li>sprites</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one has different memory management: for example, the background is on memory 4 times bigger than the screen and is rendered by indicating the offset in that memory (which can also &ldquo;roll&rdquo; from right to left!). The window has a fixed position on the screen and is updated by indicating the elements displayed. The sprites are on separate memory and get the highest priority in the rendering.</p>
<p>Luca implemented everything in Rust to learn it, so the code was not so idiomatic. However, he made sure to implement a correct emulator by making it pass all tests, which consisted of actual binaries to run on the emulator. Talk about end-to-end testing!</p>
<h3 id="ddd-vs-hexagonal-architecture---luca">DDD vs Hexagonal Architecture - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucagiovenzana/"  target="_blank" >Luca</a></h3>
<p>Luca held a discussion on the nature of Domain-Driven Design and how it relates to Hexagonal Architecture.</p>
<p>It all started from a comment on LinkedIn (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7377325627579916288?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7377325627579916288%2C7377351154210521088%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287377351154210521088%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7377325627579916288%29"  target="_blank" >here</a>) in which a commenter said that mixing DDD and HA brought painful misconceptions. Luca didn&rsquo;t understand the issue and brought it to the group. What followed was a discussion on what DDD really is, and why Hexagonal Architecture is not the same thing.</p>
<p>From what I understood, DDD relates to the business decisions about the architecture: what components should be implemented in-house (&ldquo;core&rdquo; and &ldquo;support&rdquo; domains) and what can be left to existing systems or contractors (&ldquo;common&rdquo; domains). Hexagonal Architecture is instead a particular architectural style used to structure our code (using inversion of control as a tool to protect the core domain from all side effects, e.g., API controllers and database implementation). This aligns with what I have studied reading <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/"  target="_blank" >Learning DDD</a> by Vlad Khononov.</p>
<p>Mixing the two concepts (thinking you are doing DDD only because you follow Hexagonal, or the inverse) can lead to misconceptions. Luca thought that Hexagonal Architecture is always useful and at zero-cost, but others didn&rsquo;t think the same, and that&rsquo;s why he started the discussion from that post.</p>
<p>It was a nice discussion! After, I kept thinking about architecture üòÖ (e.g., how I don&rsquo;t use either DDD or Hexagonal Architecture at work, and how to introduce them).</p>

<p>Paolo brought a talk on static vs dynamic typing. Said like this, it could seem like a simple argument, but he showed how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p>First, programming is a pendulum. Trends come, go, and come back! This is true for architecture (monoliths -&gt; microservices -&gt; monoliths), for where to put computation (remote vs local), but also for type checking in languages!</p>
<p>We always talk about static vs dynamic typing, but Paolo explained that we should be more precise with our definitions. What actually changes is <em>when</em> the types are checked.</p>
<p>The concept I bring home from this talk is: every language has types (apart from Forth, it seems). Some languages are more strict, others less, some check at runtime and some at compilation; some infer types and others don&rsquo;t. Paolo&rsquo;s talk was interesting and eye-opening, but most of all hilarious üòÇ it was great.</p>

<p>In the final session of the day (or at least I thought), Arialdo showed us the new cool kid in the town of versioning tools: <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/"  target="_blank" >Jujutsu</a>. It&rsquo;s a version control system that extends Git with some neat commands and patterns&hellip; and provides extreme freedom to move commits and branches around.</p>
<p>Arialdo showed many commands and tricks that would be cumbersome with Git, but just a command away with Jujutsu: renaming commits, moving commits, creating temporary merge commits to keep in sync with all changes from others, moving stuff around, and so much more.</p>
<p>After his demonstration, I&rsquo;ll definitely try it (even though I don&rsquo;t use fancy commands and my final goal would be trunk-based development&hellip; üòá).</p>
<h3 id="bonus-pre-dinner-session-xpugbg-book-club">Bonus Pre-dinner Session: XPUGBg Book Club</h3>
<p>Every Friday (almost) I attend a Book Club organized by the XPUG Bergamo group. Being a Friday, and also being most of the members present at SoCraTes, why not hold a session before dinner?</p>
<p>At the moment (and also at the moment of writing this post), we were reading the book &ldquo;Seven Languages in Seven Weeks&rdquo; by Bruce A. Tate (<a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/"  target="_blank" >link</a>).</p>
<p>We re-read (we were actually stuck on that) the chapter about Prolog, trying to reproduce the book example on map coloring, but without using the same structure as the book used! It was difficult (and we didn&rsquo;t reach the conclusion), but being all together physically made the experience even better!</p>

<p>During his <a href="#a-presentation-on-types" >talk</a>, Paolo mentioned that building a Forth interpreter is an easy task and he does it to learn a new language.</p>
<p>So, some participants (including Luca, the GameBoy emulator guy) started implementing an interpreter for it&hellip; in Rust!! I came in after some time and they were almost finished&hellip;. but that&rsquo;s the kind of spontaneous sessions you can only see at SoCraTes! I now want to write an interpreter by myself&hellip;. üòÅ</p>

<p>Gabriele gave the first presentation of the day. To start slowly, and acclimate our brains to the challenges of the day, he used FizzBuzz, an easy and standard exercise, usually performed at interviews to filter out candidates.</p>
<p>The twist? He <strong>proved it formally</strong>, using <a href="https://github.com/agda/agda"  target="_blank" >Agda</a>. Agda is an interactive system for writing and checking proofs (yes, in the mathematical sense). If the day before we saw Nusco talking about statically checked type systems, a theorem-proving system goes way beyond: it allows us to demonstrate the intrinsic properties that an algorithm or data structure has. It&rsquo;s the pinnacle of testing, and the mortal enemy of bugs: a proven algorithm has no flaws!</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t we demonstrating every program we write? Well, theorem proving is quite difficult, sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness"  target="_blank" >to the extreme</a>. Also, expressing an algorithm mathematically is way more difficult than it seems: Gabriele took an hour just to show us how to prove that integers are integers&hellip;</p>
<p>In the end, we got a glimpse into the world of formally verifiable programs, a niche reserved only for the most critical systems. It was a mind-blowing experience (I had a headache after the session).</p>

<p>After seeing the power of mathematics and software, I went for a stroll in the hotel lobby, headed to the bar. There, I found Ruggero asking for help on architectural matters at his job.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t give any details, but we had a nice discussion on how to decouple &ldquo;invasive&rdquo; systems, such as <a href="https://temporal.io/"  target="_blank" >Temporal</a>, from the core domain of applications. Also, how do you handle migrating a legacy system that is coupled with such systems?</p>
<p>I left the bar with more questions than before.</p>

<p>How do you handle teams in a product company? And how does that relate to your software architecture?</p>
<p>Nicola started an interesting discussion (which derailed from his intended purpose) on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Reteaming-Wisdom-Changing-Teams/dp/1492061298"  target="_blank" >Dynamic Reteaming</a>.</p>
<p>Most companies divide teams based on their specialization: frontend, backend, devops, DBA, etc&hellip; Others instead use cross-functional teams, where each part of the system is seen in its entirety by a team, which has full responsibility and agency over it.</p>
<p>When trying to move from the first type to the second one, however, if the software architecture doesn&rsquo;t follow the people, we risk a disaster. If a frontend developer is thrown into a newly founded cross-functional team, they will still talk with other frontend developers if all the frontend code is still in the same place (and has the same structure) as before.</p>
<p>What Nicola learned from the book (and applies in his work with <a href="https://qmates.tech/"  target="_blank" >Qmates</a>) is to slowly turn both the organization and the architecture where needed. For example, a single cross-functional team might be extracted from the specialized teams, and the architecture must follow by extracting the &ldquo;slice&rdquo; from the software, making the team really independent.</p>
<p>It was a nice discussion, and I learned that organizations can, and should, be more &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; in their team structures. I still wonder how this relates to my job (working in a small consultancy, where each team has its project but not all roles are &ldquo;covered&rdquo;), but it was still enlightening.</p>

<p>At SoCraTes, there is a move that gets its distinctive name from its original creator: the <em>Arialdo move</em>. An Arialdo move consists of proposing a session in which <em>someone else</em> has to give a presentation/workshop/talk/whatever.</p>
<p>This year, Arialdo did his move with Emanuele, forcing him to give a session on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamorphism"  target="_blank" >Catamorphisms</a> in F#.</p>
<p>I got into this session late and didn&rsquo;t follow it enough to understand what catamorphisms are üòÖ. Nonetheless, the Arialdo move is one of the things that make an Unconference memorable!</p>
<h3 id="extreme-contracts-discussion---matteo">Extreme Contracts discussion - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteototo/"  target="_blank" >Matteo</a></h3>
<p>The last session of the day was more relaxed than the rest. Matteo started a discussion on the book <a href="https://leanpub.com/extremecontracts-italia"  target="_blank" >Extreme Contracts</a> by Jacopo Romei.</p>
<p>How should we value our work, or how should a company give prices to its consultancy work? Some just bill the time spent developing software (more risk to the customer, as they might be paying for nothing). Others provide a precise estimate and use a project-based pricing model (riskier for the contractor, as scope is usually underestimated).</p>
<p>The book provides a third way, which is asking for <em>value</em>. If the customer is going to spend less (or be more profitable) thanks to my work, then we should ask for a part of that profit (in addition to a lower base fee)!</p>
<p>I also offered a different solution, which is the one employed by <a href="https://www.zupit.it/"  target="_blank" >Zupit</a>: use an agile contract and make the customer pay for the value delivered (measured using Story Points) for each sprint. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a perfect model (actually, using story points as price is against agile principles in my opinion), but it allows us to reconsider the relationship with the customer periodically and lowers the risk for both parties. The customer is paying for actual features delivered, but without the risks on long projects.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it! This was SoCraTes 2025.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t add all the little trivia (e.g., mechanical keyboards, chess and board games challenges, and of course&hellip; beer) that accompanied the main event. Unfortunately, those can only be lived by being there.</p>
<p>I hope this journal made you want to attend the next SoCraTes, or another similar event. Unconferences are a great way to learn, discuss, and have fun.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

          <p>Hi üëã welcome to a new post.</p>
<p>Today, I want to share a small glimpse of my experience at the 2024 Polenta &amp; Deploy event!</p>
<p>Polenta&amp;Deploy is an event taking place nestled beneath the mountains at Pinzolo. Over the course of three days, developers (and others) come together to enjoy the fresh air and discuss about tech (and not only that&hellip;) in an open space setup.</p>
<p><em>(Disclaimer: I didn&rsquo;t attend the previous editions, so please correct me if I&rsquo;m mistaken)</em></p>
<p>It all started after COVID restriction were lifted in 2021, and the <del>old</del> young trio of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aacerbis/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Acerbis</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocolla/"  target="_blank" >Alessandro Colla</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinandosantacroce/"  target="_blank" >Ferdinando Santacroce</a> gathered and pondered &ldquo;We want to meet people again, we&rsquo;re tired of online events!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From a telegram chat and a shared google doc, the three were able to organise an unconference, and we are now at the third edition.</p>
<p>Below you can find my &ldquo;journal&rdquo; of the event. Enjoy! (I know I&rsquo;m the only one reading through the entire post, but that&rsquo;s ok üòé).</p>

<h3 id="first-day-trip-and-nightly-snowshoe-hike">First Day: Trip and Nightly Snowshoe hike</h3>
<p>The first day started way before arriving at the hotel. I left Bergamo for the mountains with a guest: <a href="https://jagasantagostino.com/"  target="_blank" >Jaga</a>! During the trip we talked about his newfound love for home automation (I discovered a great millimiter-wave sensor that can track inside the house, and much more), home servers and his life in Sardinia.</p>
<p>After arriving at the nice small village of Pinzolo, it was time for the first activity of the Polenta&amp;Deploy: lunch! To inaugurate the event, I ate a nice Polenta with pork shank.</p>

<p>With a full stomach, it was now time for the first <strong>real</strong> activity: along with other fearless souls, we did a snowshoe hike in the Madonna di Campiglio park. It&rsquo;s been been 15 years since the last time I put snowshoes on, and it was not so easy! I did struggle a bit, but in the end we arrived at the hut (well, more like a 5-star restaurant&hellip;we&rsquo;re  in Trentino after all). Although we didn&rsquo;t hit our planned destination (we were 1 km short, and 200m below), we were still pretty satisfied. The hike was fantastic. I&rsquo;d never been on a snowy mountain at dusk before! The atmosphere was unreal, and seeing the sunset over the snow was pure magic.</p>

<h3 id="second-day-unconference-and-a-lot-of-food">Second Day: Unconference (and a lot of food)</h3>
<p>After a long night of sleep (about 5 hours), it was time for the main dish of the Polenta&amp;Deploy: the <strong>Unconference</strong>!</p>
<p>We all gathered in the hotel hall and kicked off the <em>marketplace</em>. Like in every open space I attend, I stayed back and didn&rsquo;t proposed anything, observing the others discuss where to put their session. I know I&rsquo;m not getting the most out of the event by not proposing a discussion, session or even just sharing a question I have. I&rsquo;m still looking for compelling or &ldquo;unique&rdquo; enough not already covered by the other sessions!</p>
<p>I already explained what is an open space <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/socrates-2023/"  target="_blank" >here</a>: the core idea is to let the participants choose what, when and where to talk, by creating a neverending &ldquo;coffee-break&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a (brief) list of the sessions I attended (some for full, others briefly):</p>
<p><strong>CI: From Stars to Stables</strong> -  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-fracassi/"  target="_blank" >Marco Fracassi</a></p>
<p>In his session, Marco shared his journey with Continuous Integration. It all began during his time at 7Pixel, where they had a single (physical) &ldquo;build machine&rdquo; shared among colleagues. Despite this (&ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; by today standards) setup, they were able to develop effectively with trunk-based development and CI.</p>
<p>However, in In his current company, the CI process is flawed. Developers work in isolation on their branches, which are then reviewed (and approved by at least 2 colleagues), merged into the dev branch and checked by QA. The issue arises after the QA phase: if the feature passes the QA review, it&rsquo;s merged into main - not starting from dev, but from the original feature branch! This destroys the concept of continuous integration, as the dev and main branches are never integrated!</p>
<p>We discussed what might have brought to this situation and how could Marco solve it. The idea is that developing in this way absolves developers of responsibility (&ldquo;QA approved this, so it must be fine&rdquo;), yet it doesn&rsquo;t actually improve code quality  or system reliability. In fact, this process risks breaking main, as integration occurs after the checks.</p>
<p>The group discussed some strategies (e.g. abolishing the dev branch, introducing feature flags and so on), but we all came to a conclusion: this situation needs a &ldquo;social&rdquo; solution, not only a technical one. Solving the problem requires to break the status quo inside the company, which is difficult when everything is going fine from the economical perspective (even if the code quality suffers).</p>
<p><strong>Ugly Code and Refactor</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli/"  target="_blank" >Gianni Bombelli</a></p>
<p>Gianni showed us a snippet of production code from one of his past projects, and then asked how we would refactor it. The code was a tangled mess of if-else, but at least it was tested!</p>
<p>The crowd discussed on which steps to take to make the code more readable (e.g. extracting methods, creating interfaces, adding smaller methods, embedding magic numbers into constants etc&hellip;). Gianni was able to refactor it using polymorphism (a somewhat-strategy-pattern) and he showed us how they did it at the time.</p>
<p>It was a valuable session on pragmatism (not every refactoring and optimisation is mandatory) and how to work on production code effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Specops</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocolla/"  target="_blank" >Alessandro Colla</a></p>
<p>Every job advert seems to insist that developers to &ldquo;must be able to work under stress&rdquo;. We all recognise it as a red flag, but it&rsquo;s something we cannot avoid no matter how hard we try. Given this, how can we train people to handle and manage stress effectively?</p>
<p>Alessandro drew inspiration from his martial arts and combat training and started a discussion with us. We exchanged a lot of quotes, links and ideas regarding team building and humility to stress management and being a great team player in general!</p>
<p>Another nice perk of being at an unconference&hellip;the discussion was done under the sun on the hotel terrace! Some of us were on reclining chairs.. as for me, I relaxed on a beanbag chair the entire time (talk about managing stress!).</p>
<p><strong>Recursive Thought</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanueledb/"  target="_blank" >Emanuele Delbono</a></p>
<p>Emanuele held a live coding session on Elixir, showing the exercises he used while reading The Little Schemer book (his solutions can be found <a href="https://github.com/emadb/the_little_alchemist"  target="_blank" >here</a>).</p>
<p>All the exercises he showed were about recursion. I understood some of them, but the latest were more difficult than expected! His explanation on tail recursion was clear, and I finally understood what it meant.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes Showdown</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludusrusso/"  target="_blank" >Ludovico Russo</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreafrancia/"  target="_blank" >Andrea Francia</a>**</p>
<p>In this session, Andrea ranted about Kubernetes, explaining why he think it&rsquo;s too complex to be used in most projects. On the other hand, Ludovico showed his <a href="https://www.ludusrusso.dev/blog/2022/09/kubernello"  target="_blank" >kubernello</a>, a small VM instance with kubernetes that he uses for small production projects. His setup was quite interesting, with automatic certificates and dns management, gitops and all at low cost! He was so inspiring I might actually create a small k8s cluster on Raspberry Pis (yes, it might be trivial and not interesting, but I don&rsquo;t care).</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphism in different languages</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeloceccato/"  target="_blank" >Angelo Ceccato</a>**</p>
<p>Angelo started his discussion by showing a graph with all the main programming languages and going back to the roots. Together with the participants, he tried to distill what constitutes Object-Oriented Programming (we had a board full of post-it with definitions). He then tried to link together concepts from all these languages and define the main topic of his discussion: Polymorphism.</p>
<p>I must admit that I didn&rsquo;t follow the discussion too much, but it provided a lot of perspectives on concepts we don&rsquo;t usually think too much about in OOP. It was a trip in the history of programming languages concepts and styles.</p>
<p><strong>There is no silver bullet</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morialberto/"  target="_blank" >Alberto Mori</a></p>
<p>Alberto asked for help/feedback on a talk he proposed to a conference. The title of his talk was &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no siver bullet&rdquo; (a clear reference to Fred Brooks&rsquo; paper, even if he didn&rsquo;t know it üòÇ) and the idea was to discuss complexity and how some techniques, even if not perfect, can help reduce it.</p>
<p>What started as a feedback session became a discussion on managing the complexity of human and business behaviour. We talked about essential and accidental complexity, different &ldquo;layers&rdquo; of complexity, on how a company can learn to tackle the complexity and how to communicate it to the customer and the developers without being overwhelmed by the task.</p>
<h3 id="third-day-unconference-and-goodbye">Third Day: Unconference and Goodbye</h3>
<p>The last day started with a good breakfast (the perks of good conferences). While a small group went out for a <em>short</em> hike (more on that later), we picked up where we left off the day before and continued the unconference.</p>
<p>Here are the sessions I attended (just three, we finished by midday):</p>
<p><strong>Intro to Qwik</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludusrusso/"  target="_blank" >Ludovico Russo</a></p>
<p>A nice quirk of unconferences is the chance to <del>force</del> <em>ask</em> other people to give sessions. This was the case, when Gerson asked Ludovico to show him how <a href="https://qwik.dev/"  target="_blank" >Qwik</a> works!</p>
<p>Ludovico obliged to the request and showed us a small example of a quik application, explaining its Server-Side-Rendering approach (resumability). I didn&rsquo;t know much about SSR, but I will try to learn it more after getting a glimpse of what it can do!</p>
<p><strong>1-on-1 for dummies</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maddalena-germinario/"  target="_blank" >Maddalena Germinario</a></p>
<p>Maddalena had her first-ever round of 1-to-1 sessions with her team after becoming tech lead&hellip; and she asked for our feedback on how to improve! The group had a discussion on how to have a great 1-to-1s, from the perspective of both the team lead and the members.</p>
<p>We talked about trust, career development, feedback, psychology, tools and methods, and it was a great source of information about 1-to-1s and how to treat people at work in general (and how to manage 1-to-1 sessions as a manager without getting crazy afterwards).</p>
<p><strong>Intro to Hono and Deploy to prod on Kubernello</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludusrusso/"  target="_blank" >Ludovico Russo</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicogandellini/"  target="_blank" >Federico Gandellini</a></p>
<p>The final session of Polenta &amp; Deploy witnessed a historic moment as Ludovico and Federico executed the first ever production deployment during a Polenta&amp;Deploy event!</p>
<p>Federico wanted to create a small application using <a href="https://hono.dev/"  target="_blank" >Hono</a>, a framework for developing backend APIs and websites in nodejs. Together with Ludovico, they developed a small application and then deployed it on Ludovico&rsquo;s kubernello.</p>
<p>Watching them develop and deploy a small page in 30 minutes was impressive, and it left me inspired to create my own small kubernello setup!
I won&rsquo;t share the final url (just in case someone decides to DDoS kubernello üòÖ), but trust me, it was a great session.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>After the unconference ended, we went to a restaurant in the mountains near Pinzolo and waited for the others.</p>
<p>I made a good choice staying at the hotel for the unconference&hellip; the <em>small</em> hike the other group started in the morning turned out to be a 3/4 hour-long adventure in the snow (sans snowshoes this time) and the group came back late, tired, and wet!</p>
<p>We ate the last polenta, and as the rain started to fall and replace the snow around us, it reminded us it was time to go home.</p>
<p>This Polenta &amp; Deploy was great. I already had my unconference initiation at <a href="https://marcobacis.dev/blog/socrates-2023/"  target="_blank" >SoCraTes</a>, and I firmly believe this format is way better than any standard conference.</p>
<p>An unconference offers a safe, intimate space where everyone can share their opinions, provide feedback, and support others. Being surrounded by the Trentino mountains was the cherry on top for me. While I&rsquo;m not particularly happy to hike on them (too hard!), I do love being in the mountains and spending time with like-minded people, so this was an incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and see you next time!</p>
