        <p>Hi üëã welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I want to write a short post about my recent adventure with open source software, and in particular the experience at my very first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/open-source-saturday-milano/"  target="_blank" >Open Source Saturday Milan</a>!</p>
<p>Open Source Saturday is an event held once a month, organised by <a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana"  target="_blank" >Gabriele</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fusillicode"  target="_blank" >Gianluca</a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielemegna"  target="_blank" >Daniele</a>. The format is simple: some nerds gather for the entire day in a specific place, and the goal is to contribute to open source!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the day, everyone presents himself and gives a short pitch of what he wants to do for the day. The possibilities are endless:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask for help on a personal project</li>
<li>propose a new project to develop alone or with others</li>
<li>look for projects in a specific technology/framework/paradigm</li>
<li>gather along and find out what to do and get inspired (my case)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I have never contributed to an open source project before. Yes, I have some repos online, but they are just exercises or university projects. Also, this was my first time participating in this kind of event, so I was both excited and worried at the same time.</p>
<p>I arrived at the location with the idea of learning Rust. In fact, in the last two weeks I was reading the online rust <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/"  target="_blank" >book</a> (again) to get a better idea about ownership and lifetimes. So, my pitch was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Marco and I know nothing of rust, so I&rsquo;m looking for a rust project to contribute to!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, things turn out differently form what we expect. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even see a single line of rust!</p>
<p>As I listened to the others presenting their projects, one project in particular caught my attention: <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri"  target="_blank" >Giacomo</a> is a main contributor to a functional programming language called <a href="https://gleam.run/"  target="_blank" >gleam</a>, which had a compiler written in Rust.</p>
<p>This was my chance! I approached giacomo after the &ldquo;standup&rdquo; and started learning about Gleam and its environment. First I followed the gleam <a href="https://tour.gleam.run/"  target="_blank" >tour</a> to get a glimpse of what the language was all about.</p>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid image" src="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2024-feb-open-source-saturday/./gleam_mascot.png" title="Gleam and its mascot, Lucy the star" alt="Gleam and its mascot, Lucy the star" />




<figcaption class="caption">Gleam and its mascot, Lucy the star</figcaption>

</figure></p>
<p>Gleam is a functional programming language focused on type safety, expressiveness and reliability. It&rsquo;s not a pure functional language like haskell in that it allows to write sequential instruction&hellip;but the rest is all functional and immutable üëç.</p>
<p>Gleam can be transpiled for two runtimes: the BEAM virtual machine of erlang, and javascript (both node and browser versions). This might be an unusual choice, but I think it can help the language spread more. After all, erlang is a <strong>very</strong> reliable language for large scale applications, and javascript is the ubiquitous language for the web. Targeting both worlds allows to cover the full stack, and using a FP language with a strong type system allows to get the best of both worlds (reliability and safeness, even when using a brittle language like javascript üî•).</p>
<p>Instead of directly starting with the compiler (after all, a compiler is a dangerous beast, and I don&rsquo;t know enough about both rust and compilers to do something useful in a single day ü•≤), Giacomo showed me his pretty printing library written in gleam, called <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/glam"  target="_blank" >glam</a>.  He then started giving a primer on how pretty printing works. I never thought about it, but printing and formatting text is not an easy task, and Giacomo&rsquo;s library does a great job in defining custom formatting specs.</p>
<p>We tried defining a pretty-printing format for json together as an exercise. It wasn&rsquo;t so trivial after all, and helped me get an idea of how the library worked.</p>
<p>After all this preparation (we already had lunch, and the end of the day was approaching fast), it was time for my first PR! I had to add a small functionality, the possibility to add &ldquo;zero width strings&rdquo; to the formatting specification. A zero width string is a string which doesn&rsquo;t impact the total line length of the formatted document. This length is used by the formatting algorithm to decide when to break a piece of output in multiple lines, so it&rsquo;s pretty important. An example of zero width strings are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code"  target="_blank" >ANSI escape codes</a>, used in the console to do crazy stuff (change colorus, set the cursor position and so on). These characters do not impact the line width usually, so they are the perfect candidate for this feature.</p>
<p>In the end, the functionality itself was a 1-line method. I added an example and a couple of tests for the method and sent my first PR! Fortunately for me I had Giacomo side-by-side, so I didn&rsquo;t experience the usual async review of open source projects. Even if he later did some modifications to my PR (changing the way my test worked and other stuff) I had <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/glam/pull/12"  target="_blank" >my first PR ever</a> merged!</p>
<p>

<figcaption class="caption">The right kind of dopamine hit</figcaption>

</figure></p>
<p>After merging my PR, we worked together on another issue he had for his project: creating a <code>debug</code> method to pretty-print a document specification itself. I basically watched him do all the work, but it was interesting to see some gleam features (such as pipelines, string concatenation and so on) and in the end we had a nice result.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Time for some considerations.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun! This was my first Open Source Saturday, and I managed to do way more than I expected. I thought I wasn&rsquo;t prepared, that I needed a brilliant idea to bring, that I&rsquo;d make a fool of myself&hellip; but none of this was true! The important thing is to participate with an open mind and simply enjoy it.</p>
<p>Giacomo was a perfect mentor. He showed me the basics of gleam, brought me a project and even an issue on which to work, and in the end helped me with the review and PR process. I was basically hand-held through the process, and I think it&rsquo;s the perfect way to start contributing without all the fear and the bias the open source world has (for some of us at least)!</p>
<p>Finally, this event reminded me that there is a lot to learn, and that outside of the main languages and frameworks there&rsquo;s an entire world of alternative paradigms and technologies. I didn&rsquo;t even know gleam existed until today, or that pretty-printing algorithms were a thing üòÖ.</p>
<p>In the end&hellip;.did I write this entire self-celebrating post for a 1-line method? Yes, and I&rsquo;m very proud of it!</p>
<p>See you next time! üòú</p>

        <p>Hi ¬†üëã and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I want to share with you a summary on the last meetup I attended, organized by the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/xpugmi/"  target="_blank" >Milan eXtreme Programming Group</a>.</p>
<p>This time , <a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana"  target="_blank" >Gabriele Lana</a> gave his advice on the pros and cons of microservices, and the problems (and solutions) that he found in his experience.</p>
<p>Gabriele is a consultant with over 20 years of experience, founder of the Milan XPUG and a nerd at heart (he still likes to play with cabinets and has contributed to a <a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana/emacs-nes"  target="_blank" >NES simulator in emacs</a>, among other stuff!!).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
<h2 id="microservices-architecture-definition">Microservices Architecture Definition</h2>
<p>Gabriele started with a premise: Microservices are currently (and have been for  years) still in their &ldquo;hype&rdquo; phase. Hype is a double-edged sword: it means that it&rsquo;s easier to get buy-in for using them, but (as all engineers know) there&rsquo;s the risk to <em>fit the problem to the solution</em>, instead of finding the right solution for the job.
In fact, microservices are most of the times used without proper reasons, and that&rsquo;s the main source of issues.</p>
<p>Then, he gave a simple definition of microservices (which can be used to describe anything really, as he admitted): &ldquo;<em>Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But how big should a microservices be in reality? Given the &ldquo;micro&rdquo; prefix, we might think that their size matters. Some schools of thought say they should be as big as a small team can implement in a month, others will talk in terms of number of lines (hundreds? thousands?). The advent of serverless computing has made thei size even more relevant.</p>
<p>Gabriele gave the usual answer: <em>it depends</em>!</p>
<p>But what does it depends from? For Gabriele, the size of a microservice should be intended as the size perceived from outside, such as the API surface.
A microservice might have millions of lines (e.g. doing video encoding and processing) but still be &ldquo;micro&rdquo; because it does just one thing!! On the other hand, a small CRUD service might have a large surface area and handle a lot of entities, and thus be too complex to make a single microservice. In the end, the size depends on the domain of the system we are going to develop for.</p>

</figure></p>
<p>After giving a mandatory definition of microservices and their &ldquo;micro&rdquo;-ness, Gabriele gave an overview of the pros and cons of employing a microservices architecture in our systems.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the pros of microservice architectures:</p>
<p><strong>Diversity</strong></p>
<p>With microservices, the company can diversify their technology: each microservice can in fact be implemented with the most suitable language or framework for the problem.
In addition to this, diversity allows to integrate new technologies in a system without rewriting everything from scratch! It also allows to be more appealing to engineers who want to learn new languages, and to follow the trends (still being cautious of using too much new technology - stick to the old, good stuff!).
One con of diversity is that it can bring more complexity (see below) and requires more standards and a better culture.</p>
<p><strong>Resiliency</strong></p>
<p>If you partition well the responsibilities inside the system, splitting it in multiple microservices helps increase its availability.
Even when some services are down, the others stays up, and that increases the resiliency of the application as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>By splitting an architecture in services, each functionality can scale differently from the others. For example, a central feature of the system might need more resources to run and be used by many users, while other parts of the system might need less resources.
This scalability pro is even more useful when using serverless architectures, which in some cases can help cut costs considerably.</p>
<p><strong>Independence</strong></p>
<p>Independence here is related to the possibility to independently deploy different parts of the system at different times and frequency. By deploying services independently, we can keep the availability of the system high and allow developers to develop features without the fear of &ldquo;big bad deployments&rdquo; (the one you don&rsquo;t want to do on a friday).</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Conway&rsquo;s law states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this law, using microservices helps in aligning the technical side of the system to the topology of the organization (e.g. assigning a microservice to each team separately).</p>
<p>However, microservices can also lead the opposite to happen, called <em>Inverse conway&rsquo;s law</em>: given an existing system, the organization is forced to organise in the same way as the system&rsquo;s components! This is usually difficult to perform, and leads to issues down the line.</p>
<p><strong>Composability</strong></p>
<p>Here Gabriele just said &ldquo;ah&hellip;classic&rdquo; ü•≤ so I have nothing to write.</p>
<p>If I have to add two lines on the argument, I can cite something Gabriele said later, which is that microservices are just a deployment method, and all the rest is standard software architecture and design. So, composability is not a pro by itself, but it&rsquo;s a requirement for doing microservices üòú.</p>
<p><strong>Replaceability</strong></p>
<p>Finally, microservices are easily replaceable. I can implement a service, then experiment with it. The usual examples are canaries (used in deployments) and A/B tests. By being independent and resilient, microservices allows to experiment much more than a monolith, without impacting on the entire product at once.</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>After listing all the (somewhat) pros of microservices, Gabriele started explaining the cons. They are less than the pros, but of way higher magnitude, and can impact much more the business and the developers if encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Microservices introduce complexity on multiple levels. The main one is the communication.  Calling a method in a monolith is a straightforward thing to do: just call the method and, if no cosmic rays are involved, you will know the answer right away.</p>
<p>Distributed systems are a different thing altogether. When you send a message to another component, you cannot know if you will receive a response, and cannot know why (did the other component receive the message but didn&rsquo;t complete? did it complete the request but I wasn&rsquo;t able to receive the response? is the other component malicious?).</p>
<p>In addition to the inherent complexity of the network, splitting a system into multiple services introduces complexity in the communication patterns (I need other services to other data) which can be worsened if the system isn&rsquo;t partitioned properly.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>Microservices can make unit testing easy and fast (the service is small afterall). It&rsquo;s the integration testing which becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>How can we test microservices?</p>
<p>Some techniques (such as using mocks and contract testing to check the connection with other services) are useful, but they allow to test a part of the system. Testing the whole system becomes more difficult, and testing it while maintaining independence of development and deployment is even more complex.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Deploying a microservices architecture requires more automation on the infrastructure, and more so if the number of services increases. The business must have a strong DevOps culture to manage this kind of system effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
<p>Forget strong consistency and ACID properties! With microservices comes the burden of eventual consistency and asynchronous communication (at least to make the most out of it).</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>This is not a con per se, but a factor that must be considered. For simple application a microservices architecture might be too expensive, while it could bring the costs down for a complex system (more so if using serverless).</p>
<p><strong>(Plus) Debugging</strong></p>
<p>In the same way testing is more complex, debugging also becomes more difficult while dealing with microservices, especially if an issue is caused by multiple services. It&rsquo;s essential to setup observability (tracing and logging) as first thing when using microservices, and even with these tools tracking an error can be difficult.</p>
<h2 id="3-of-the-worst-problems">3 of the Worst Problems</h2>
<p>The first part of this summary covers just 30 minutes of the talk. What is the rest of the meetup about (one hour and half)?</p>
<p>In the main part of his talk, Gabriele highlighted the 3 worst issues affecting microservices architectures, their causes, symptoms, cure and prevention!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t take much notes on this part, so this summary will be shorter than the pros/cons. To learn more, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1quMproQ5Hk"  target="_blank" >video</a>.</p>

<p>The first (and worst) risk with microservices architecture is to partition the system wrong!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you design the system the wrong way, using microservices will only worsen the issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gabriele sees microservices only as a deploy model, in the sense that they aren&rsquo;t a solution to bad software design, but just a tool.</p>
<p>When the system is badly designed (with <strong>high coupling</strong> and <strong>low cohesion</strong>) making changes becomes exponentially more difficult. When a component needs some data which is not in the right spot, it needs to communicate with another service to get it. If this happens too many times, it means the component suffers of a pattern called <em>feature envy</em>. The envious component keeps asking for data (or actions) to the other component.</p>
<p>The issue is made worse by the network: when a component is envious in a monolith, all is solved with a method call. In a microservice architecture this involves the network instead, with all its related issues (latency, availability, byzantine faults and so on)!</p>
<p>In the 90s/2000s vendors tried to sell similar stuff, with CORBA and RMI. This didn&rsquo;t end well&hellip;instead, it&rsquo;s important to reduce the communication to a minimum and employ the Single Responsibility Principle, in the same way we employ it in a standard OOP monolith. As already said above, a bad system design will just get worse with microservices.</p>
<p>What can we do if we have a big ball of mud monolith and need to split it? The first thing is to refactor the monolith in order to fix the mess, and only then to split it in microservices! It&rsquo;s important to disentangle and uncouple all the components while it&rsquo;s still easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what if everything is strongly connected because of our domain?&rdquo; Gabriele provoked us with a questioner a customer may give. The solution is simple&hellip;.keep the monolith! Using microservices is not mandatory, and should be done only if there is the need (and the skill) to do it. Splitting a strongly coupled system wrong instead would only lead to pain.</p>
<h3 id="2-shared-database">2. Shared Database</h3>
<p>This is an issue I&rsquo;ve been guilty multiple times: using a shared database between microservices!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First rule of microservices: each microservice must have a separate database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If multiple services share the same db (access and schema altogether), then the database becomes the same as a central, global variable that everyone has access to. With a central database there is no independent deploy (how can I run migration and change the schema if others depend on it?) and making changes becomes difficult.</p>
<p>But what causes the presence of a shared database? Gabriele gave a few culprits:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the DB is used to configure/customise the system</li>
<li>Data Driven Design (when we first design the tables and then the rest)</li>
<li>Database Normalization (how we are tipically taught to design a DB schema&hellip;)</li>
<li>False need of strong consistency from the business side</li>
<li>Database containing business logic as the central part of the system (e.g. using triggers and stored procedures)</li>
</ul>
<p>How can we prevent this from happening?
The first thing to do it to not fear denormalization and to stop doing data-driven design. Instead, we should base our design on the behaviour and actions of the users (so DDD, BDD and so on) and learn that it&rsquo;s ok to split the data related to an entity among multiple databases!</p>
<p>Gabriele gave the example of the humble <strong>Order</strong> entity. An order can be represented differently by each distinct department inside the company. Each can add tens of fields into it&hellip; Sometimes the order might even be created before the user is logged or even if the goods are not available yet!</p>
<p>What should we do in this case? Create a single table with hundreds of (mostly unrelated) fields and used by all services? Nope!</p>
<p>Instead, we should have a shared id for the same entity, but store it in every microservice only with the data pertaining to that service, of which the service is responsible. It might be the Shipping Address for the logistics service, the credit card details for the Finance service, and the id and position of the goods for the warehouse service.</p>
<h3 id="3-distributed-monolith">3. Distributed Monolith</h3>
<p>The last issue Gabriele mentioned is the infamous &ldquo;Distributed Monolith&rdquo;. It happens when we use too much synchronous communication when building our microservices, coupling the system and making it harder to change and deploy independently.</p>
<p>Synchronous communication creates more coupling than asynchronous, because when sending a synchronous request, we wait for the response&hellip;. what could go wrong? As already seen with the other 2 issues, everything!!</p>
<p>The solution for this issue is to embrace asynchronous communication between services (not caring if the response arrives and when) and eventual consistency. Many system can work just fine with eventual consistency, even if we don&rsquo;t realise it.</p>
<p>Gabriele also mentioned some concepts of <em>distributed system design</em> that can help create a reliable distributed system, such as the use of circuit breakers. In the end, we must understand the distributed nature of microservice and not to go against it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Gabriele&rsquo;s talk was a long and detailed list of reasons why not to use microservices üòÇ.  I really liked his style of presentation (without filters and talking about real systems and issues).</p>
<p>I recently read the book &ldquo;Building Microservices&rdquo; by Sam Newman, and most of the advice given in the book resonated with Gabriele&rsquo;s talk, most of all in the issues that microservices can cause if not implemented properly. This discussion also remembered me that microservices are a tool, and that it all start with a good software design first (and second, third, fourth and so on üòÖ).</p>
<p>Be it an existing system or a greenfield project, it&rsquo;s important to decouple and separate the system properly before splitting it, and focusing on distributed systems&rsquo; issues and solutions (such as denormalization, async communication, event-based systems and so on) can make the difference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this time! I hope you liked my short summary of a long talk. You can find the meetup video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1quMproQ5Hk"  target="_blank" >here</a>.</p>

<p>Typical developer performing a kata</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kata&rdquo; is a term borrowed from martial arts. It refers to &ldquo;a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but can also be reviewed within groups and in unison when training&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata"  target="_blank" >Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Developers have adopted this term and applied it to their set of movements, which include coding, testing, and designing. A kata is a short problem/exercise meant to be practiced many times. The same kata can be practiced with different languages, approaches, and methodologies, providing a new perspective each time to learn.</p>
<p>In Katurday sessions, the focus is on practicing one or more katas with other people, usually by doing pair or mob programming. By practicing in a group, we step out of our comfort zone (programmers aren&rsquo;t the best at socializing) and receive immediate feedback from more experienced developers, while also having fun together!</p>
<h1 id="sessions-journal">Sessions journal</h1>
<p>Here I&rsquo;ll keep an updated list of the session in which I take part, so be sure to check this page every month for a new entry (and even if I&rsquo;m the only one reading this, I&rsquo;ll keep writing it as a journal üòõ).</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="first-contact-mob-programming">First contact: Mob programming</h2>
<p>In the first meetup, the main goal was to get to know each other and practice together for the first time. And the perfect opportunity to learn with others in a psychologically safe way is mob programming!</p>
<p>In mob programming, one person (the driver) writes the code on a PC while the others (the mob) discuss what to implement and how. The discussion is moderated by a navigator, who is the person actually telling the driver what to do.</p>
<p>We practiced the <a href="https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/"  target="_blank" >Roman numerals</a> kata using mob programming and test-driven development. Given that there were too many people for a structured discussion, we used a method called <em>fishbowl</em>, in which a small group is in the mob while the rest of the audience watches (already described in <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/"  target="_blank" >this post</a> about another XPUG meetup).</p>
<p>The mob members and the navigator rotate from the audience, with a set time. Basically, if anyone had something to say or discuss about the task, they ‚Äúpatiently‚Äù waited for their turn üòÖ</p>
<p>This experience was interesting, showing that a group of software developers can come up with a high-quality and tested solution without fighting (too much).</p>
<h2 id="second-session-pairing-and-tdd">Second session: Pairing and TDD</h2>
<p>On the second meetup, we stepped out of our comfort zone. The goal this time was to practice pair programming and test-driven development. Why both practices together? Well, we had already practiced TDD in the latest session, but this time it was part of the pairing exercise itself.</p>
<p>How can TDD help make pair programming better? With <strong>ping-pong</strong> programming! One developer writes a failing test (red phase of TDD). Then, the other developer makes the test pass (green phase) and can apply some refactoring while still passing tests. Finally, they create a new failing test and give it to the first developer. This ‚Äúping-pong‚Äù between the members keeps them concentrated on the task at hand and allows them to write code as if only one person wrote it.</p>
<p>We practiced the <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/587e4b656c87d3e7f4000143"  target="_blank" >prime factors kata</a> in multiple sessions, erasing the code at the end and pairing up with another person we didn&rsquo;t know. In this kind of exercise (as in any kata), the goal is not to finish it, but to try new ways to solve it and learn. Also, by changing partners every time, we are forced to get to know a new person (duh!), and sometimes even a new programming language/framework, tools, and in general a completely new environment (e.g. different keyboard layout and operating system). It&rsquo;s obvious that changing this much on every rotation doesn&rsquo;t always allow us to finish the kata, but that&rsquo;s expected.</p>
<p>In the end, we did two pairing sessions and a final feedback session in which we shared our views on ping-pong pairing and TDD in general. It was useful to see that other people had the same ideas and concerns as me, and also different ideas about the exercise.</p>
<h2 id="third-session-refactoring">Third session: Refactoring</h2>
<p>In this session, we tackled a difficult task: refactoring a piece of code that was intentionally made unreadable, the <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata"  target="_blank" >tennis refactoring kata</a> by Emily Bache. The repository contains the same kata implemented (with lots of code smells) in most of the mainstream programming languages. For each project, it also contains a comprehensive test suite, making it perfect for practicing refactoring without worrying about the tests.</p>
<p>As in every other Katurday session, we worked in pairs and had a set time to finish. We started by choosing a language and then identified code smells, solving them by refactoring the code. In reality, my partner and I just started saying &ldquo;wow, that code sucks&rdquo; for every piece of code in the project and tried to refactor it with our gut feeling. The result came out nicely, but we didn&rsquo;t apply the rules to the letter. Nonetheless, it was still a learning experience, seeing how a comprehensive test suite helps to refactor without fear (which I cannot say about the projects I usually work on üòÖ).</p>
<p>One interesting technique we used was loop unrolling (example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQjUKQxFXuE"  target="_blank" >here</a>) to refactor a useless and complex loop. I had already encountered it in university to improve performance (and used it in unconventional ways for FPGA synthesis), but I never thought of it as a refactoring technique üòÉ.</p>
<p>After making our way through the refactoring, every pair shared their experience. It was useful to see many different approaches to the problem: top-down like ours (extracting and simplifying unrelated and big parts of the code) and bottom-up (refactoring a small but common part of the code at a time).</p>
<p>Finally, given the small amount of time remaining, we decided not to proceed with another pair/mob session, but instead watched <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-bombelli?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAfrrkABbUvjAiZv3U8jyjDXz1fq-gu6jBA&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BwlZNIMK2RViUFptWfbZVKA%3D%3D"  target="_blank" >Gianni</a> refactor a fizzbuzz exercise in Kotlin to make it more generic and expandable ü§© a great live refactoring lesson.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-session-object-calisthenics">Fourth session: Object Calisthenics</h2>
<p>After learning about TDD, pairing and refactoring, it was time to put it all together, by practicing <em>Object Calisthenics</em>.</p>
<p>Object Calisthenics is a set of (very strict) rules designed to &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; our code muscle. In particular, the rules are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only one level of indentation per method</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use the ELSE keyword</li>
<li>Wrap all primitives and strings (wrap primitive types in classes)</li>
<li>First-class collections (wrap collections in classes)</li>
<li>One dot per line</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t abbreviate</li>
<li>Keep all entities small</li>
<li>No classes with more than two instance variables</li>
<li>No getters/setters/properties</li>
<li>All classes must have state</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules help to effectively design code in a clean way, the same way real calisthenics helps to improve our strength without strange techniques and machines.</p>
<p>To practice Object Calisthenics we performed the <a href="https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/"  target="_blank" >bowling kata</a>, in which you have to compute the score of a bowling game given the throws results.
The kata seems simple at a first view, but has a nasty responsibility separation issue, as the bonus points of a frame depends on the next throws!</p>
<p>The rules were pretty frustrating when I started applying them! For example, not being able to nest the code too much meant I had to continually extract methods.
Another challenge was to always give state  to objects (so avoiding value objects).</p>
<p>Fortunately we started applying TDD from the beginning, so it was pretty easy to refactor the code while we added test cases. A challenge I always face when doing TDD is the level at which to begin: from the outside (big comprehensive tests that stay red for some time) or from the inside (smaller components and tests which are integrated later). I tend to create big tests but I also try to solve them immediately, which brings to not follow the &ldquo;little steps&rdquo; rule of TDD üòÖ.</p>
<p>In general, this katurday was really interesting, showing some &ldquo;strict&rdquo; rules that we should instead always apply to our code to make it clean and properly designed.</p>
<h2 id="thats-all">That&rsquo;s all!</h2>

        <p>Hi üëã welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>Today I‚Äôm going to post a little summary of my experience at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/xpugbg/events/290690004/"  target="_blank" >XPUGBg meetup</a> I attended at the end of January. This time, the talk was ‚ÄúeXtreme Collaborative Codebase‚Äù by Alessio Coser.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-collaborative-codebase">What is a collaborative codebase?</h2>
<p>Alessio started his talk with a question: what does it mean to collaborate in a codebase for you? What does it take to do it? What are the practices we can use to ‚Äúwork well‚Äù?</p>
<p>For him, it all comes down to optimising the work flow by accepting continuous change. In order to be more productive it‚Äôs important to reduce the work in progress, make small changes and reduce the feedback loop.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Regarding feedback, agile practices tend to work at the highest levels, that of release, iteration, acceptance and so on (as in the above picture). But what about the lower levels of feedback, down to the codebase itself? How do you ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù the feedback loop on all levels, from code to release?</p>
<p>In the talk, Alessio explains why doing trunk-based devlopment brings the best collaboration on the codebase, by improving the feedback loop, making WIP evident and allowing to ship faster and with  higher quality.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-trunk-based-development">What is trunk-based development?</h2>
<p>Trunk-based development is a practice in which developers collaborate on the codebase in a single branch (the main/master/trunk). Instead of opening a feature branch and then do a pull/merge request to master (with the corresponding code review I hope), the developer commits directly to the main branch.</p>
<p>Trunk-based development goes hand in hand with <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"  target="_blank" >continuous integration</a> and <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html"  target="_blank" >continuous delivery</a>. In fact, by committing to the main branch and keeping it always <strong>releasable</strong>, it‚Äôs possible to deliver value to the business continuously.</p>
<p>There are variations to trunk-based development. A notable one is <strong>scaled</strong> trunk-based, used when the team size increases. In scaled trunk-based development, the developers work with <strong>short-lived</strong> (less than 1 day) feature branches. The same practices (pair programming, TDD and XP in general) are still valid, together with the constraint to keep the main branch always releasable and deployable at any time.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-trunk-based-development">Advantages of trunk-based development</h2>
<p>In the talk, Alessio highlighted the <strong>impact</strong> that trunk-based development has on the codebase and on the team/business itself.</p>
<p>The first ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù is that it allows to have <strong>frequent integration</strong> (better yet, <strong>continuous</strong>) of all the changes in the codebase. In this way, conflicts that arise during development are immediately identified (and corrected), without waiting until the code is reviewed in a pull request.</p>
<p>By making all changes on the same branch (main), there is a unique source of truth. As every change is immediately integrated and tested, the codebase is always updated, and there‚Äôs no conflict over which version of the code is the correct one (the answer is: the one on the main branch!).</p>
<p>Given that the team is working on the same branch, everyone can see all the current work in progress. In addition, by not using long feature branches, and being forced to integrate with main frequently, it‚Äôs more difficult to keep multiple features in progress.</p>
<p>The possibility to make small, deliverable changes forces us to <strong>refactor</strong> into small steps, and not create too many changes and conflicts. Also, by doing this with a continuous review (e.g. by pairing), we have the freedom to refactor into small steps with confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, trunk-based increase the <strong>collaboration</strong> between team members. If what I‚Äôm working on at the moment conflicts with another developer, I‚Äôm more eager to work together to merge it, and this is done (again) immediately, and not at merge time.</p>
<h2 id="a-change-of-mentality">A change of mentality</h2>
<p>To work with trunk-based development properly, we need to embrace a (sometimes radical) change of mentality. The change reflects both in social and technical practices.</p>
<p>From the social side, trunk-based development requires:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>, as everyone is working on the same codebase at the same time</li>
<li>Constructive and frequent <strong>feedback</strong>, and being open to it</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>, in the team members and in the code itself. This can be helped with XP practices such as TDD and pairing</li>
</ul>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the most important practices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small</strong>, incremental changes (in contrast to big, breaking changes and long parallel branches)</li>
<li>Attention to <strong>quality</strong> (because the main branch must always be releasable, and every commit we push could be directly deployed in production!)</li>
<li>Separation between <strong>build, deploy and release</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A strong rule is that the code should always be deployable! This is the basis for frequent releases, which allows getting faster feedback from the business and the customers.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-deploy-while-the-work-is-in-progress">How to deploy while the work is in progress?</h4>
<p>While talking about technical practices and their impact, Alessio explained how keeping build, release and deploy separate is fundamental to a collaborative codebase. But how do we keep the code ‚Äúdeployable‚Äù even while we are currently implementing new features?</p>
<p>The first way is to do <strong>dark launching:</strong> release the new feature, but without exposing the new/changed API (or expose it only to a subset of users, e.g. developers and internal users).</p>
<p>A second way is to use <strong>branch by abstraction</strong>: put the current api under an abstraction layer, then start to implement the new functionality in another compatible class/module. While implementing the new feature, migrate the old feature clients to the new (compatible, remember!) one, and finally remove the old module. All of this should keep the system working even when the feature is not finished yet.</p>
<p>The last way to not release in-progress work is to put the new feature behind feature toggles/flags. The toggles can be static or dynamic, but they should be short-lived (if used while developing and not for mere configuration) and removed when the feature has been released and is stable. Feature flags are also a way to decouple deploy and release of the features. In addition, they make WIP evident (as any feature toggle of that type represents a work-in-progress feature).</p>
<h2 id="considerationsdiscussions">Considerations/Discussions</h2>
<p>The characteristic I like the most in meetups is the discussion with all the participants. Alessio encouraged the audience to ask questions and express their opinions, and here are some considerations of what came out of the discussion after the talk.</p>
<p>The first thing to take care of before and while doing trunk-based development is that of <strong>ownership</strong>: who is the owner of the code? Trunk-based development works best with <strong>cohesive</strong> teams working on a <strong>product</strong>, as the code is owned by the entire team (which makes the decisions). If the code is not owned by the developer, as in some consultancy projects or in open source, then it might be better to work with other branching models (such as feature-based, git flow or github flow).</p>
<p>Another consideration is that of software <strong>versioning</strong>. Trunk-based development expects a continuous integration of the code, and this means that there is only one version of the code (the current one). If the product needs multiple versions, and separate maintenance of the versions (e.g. because some customers don‚Äôt want to pay for the newer version, but still expect bugfixes on the version they own), then there should be release branches in addition to the main branch.</p>
<p>During the discussion, someone complained that with trunk based development changes are not evident. I agree in part with this, as using a separate branch would show the entire diff, while splitting the change in multiple commits would not show the entire feature at once. However, the point of trunk-based development is to make small changes, so the features should be separated in small stories, each with its own commit (or short lived branch). This improves the reliability of the team, allowing it to ship faster and estimate better.</p>
<p>A final consideration is about <strong>conflicts</strong>. While in feature branching conflicts are identified only when merging, in trunk-based all the conflicts arise during development. To keep the build releasable and stable the conflict needs to be fixed immediately, and this might seem to slow down the development of new features.</p>
<p>To avoid integration headaches, it‚Äôs important to communicate with the team and avoid conflicts in the first place. Also, it&rsquo;s better to catch conflicts and fix them immediately than to wait for a big bang merge. In my opinion, if there is a lot of churn/conflicts in some modules, it means that the architecture should be improved (by splitting the functionality into smaller modules with clear responsibilities).</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The conclusion of the talk was ‚Äú<em>embrace change</em>‚Äù, which is the fundamental principle of eXtreme Programming. I agree with this quote, as change is inevitable in software development (and in life in general).</p>
<p>I never had a collaborative codebase in the way described by Alessio (with trunk based, tdd, pairing and all the other practices), but I think that every team should strive to follow the same principles and practices.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs it for today! I hope you liked this short summary. If you want to go deeper into the topic, I left down here some resources (will be updated while I discover more of them).

        <p>Hi üëã and welcome to a new post!</p>
<p>In my 2022 review, I said that one of my goals for 2023 was to participate more in communities (meetups, conferences and so on). Well, as a first step to achieving that goal, I attended a meetup hosted by eDreams ODIGEO (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tech-talks-by-edreams-odigeo-milan-hub-inauguration-special-edition-tickets-493515075877"  target="_blank" >here</a>) on January 24th.</p>
<p>For the inauguration of their Milan Hub, eDreams hosted Sandro Mancuso for his talk ‚ÄúA Case for Outside-In Design‚Äù, in which he proposes a set of practices and techniques to make business and technology meet when designing and extending a system.</p>
<p>You may already have heard of ‚ÄúOutside-In Design‚Äù on this blog <a href="https://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/"  target="_blank" >before</a>. Sandro‚Äôs talk follows the same philosophy and extends it not only to code but to the entire business and product decisions made before coding even begin.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I will share some notes/brief recap of the talk given by Sandro. It‚Äôs by no means a complete transcription and may contain my own interpretation of what was said. Go watch his past talks (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSkDu5YgAh4"  target="_blank" >here</a>) for the real deal!</em></p>
<h3 id="developer-biases-and-the-insideoutside-perspective">Developer Biases and The Inside/Outside perspective</h3>
<p>The talk started with a list of biases (most of the time we call them ‚Äúpractices‚Äù) that affect software developers. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural biases (procedural, oop, functional, services, event-based)</li>
<li>Design biases (all architectural design patterns such as SOA, Actor model, Hexagonal arch, Microservices and so on..)</li>
<li>Design Direction biases (starting from the persistence, domain, UI, and lastly <strong>incremental outside-in</strong>, the topic of this talk)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time we tend to work led by our biases: a backend developer will start working on the domain model and then implement the details (infrastructure, application); frontend will start working from the design of the UI down to the actual implementation. However, in this way, we end up with a discrepancy between the systems, and this leads to ugly adapter layers to adapt the API exposed by the backend and the data the frontend needs to work.</p>
<p>This behaviour extends also at a higher level, that of business and product design. Technology and product work in parallel tracks, and then need to somewhat meet at the intersection: the top of the backlog. At that moment, it‚Äôs more difficult to align the product decisions needed to create value for the company and the system design.</p>
<p>Software design should <strong>serve</strong> the business, and its value should be measured by how much it impacts the business value. Thus, we need to align the two perspectives, inside (technology) and outside (business).</p>
<p>To solve this issue, Sandro proposes a different approach, in which we start from the product and then define lower and lower level abstractions of the system, contrary to the standard inside-out design approach.</p>
<h3 id="outside-in-design">Outside-In Design</h3>
<p>The first thing to do when designing a new system or a set of features for the business is to create a birds-eye view (<strong>product box</strong>) in which we put the main features that bring value, and the main functional areas involved.</p>
<p>Then, we proceed to do <strong>Impact Mapping</strong>, in which we identify the high-level bounded contexts and architecture. Starting from the main goals of the system, we identify its actors and the different impacts they have, on the deliverables (features). Sandro showed an example using mind maps, refining the different levels (actor ‚Üí impact ‚Üí feature) on every iteration.</p>
<p>After impact mapping, with <strong>Functional Mapping,</strong> we identify the business flows, the external (and internal) users and systems and connect them, in a way similar to sequence diagrams but using bounded contexts instead of classes. It allows to decide which systems are external and which are internal, and which should become public APIs or internal services. Sandro gave some examples, one in which only one service (the catalogue) was public-facing, and another (checkout) in which all services were public and called by the frontend.</p>
<p><strong>User Interaction via Mockups</strong> is the step in which we see some UI (finally!!). Sandro does the mockups with Balsamiq, as it allows the creation of dynamic wireframes. It‚Äôs better to do them with UX experts, in order to have a basic wireframe both for the UX/UI team and the development team (by designing the APIs and the data needed by the frontend).</p>
<p>Finally, we get into the actual software design and implementation with the method we prefer (Inside-Out or Outside-In TDD for example üòè).</p>
<p>All these steps might seem long, but Sandro explained that they are actually short (e.g. product box can be done in an afternoon!) and need to be performed at different intervals (6/12 months for the highest level, then 3/4 months, monthly, 1/2 weeks and finally daily for the actual coding practices).</p>
<h3 id="thats-it">That‚Äôs it!</h3>
<p>As you can see, I just wrote a quick summary of Sandro‚Äôs talk. The meetup also included a panel with Sandro and three people from eDreams ODIGEO (the CTO Carsten Bernhard, Milan‚Äôs Hub Director Luca Pivotto and Agile Director Brett Ansley), in which they continued the argument brought by the talk and expanded with other content (e.g. how to tackle and measure technical debt, what is value and much more). I didn‚Äôt include it in this post as I didn‚Äôt take notes üòÖ.</p>
<p>Overall, the meetup was really interesting. The outside-in perspective is (as in the last meetup I attended) a great way to meet the tech side of the business (working on the nitty-gritty details and implementation) and the product side (concerned with value, customers and overall functionality of the system).</p>
<p>I think that this could be really useful in both big companies (to iterate on new features) and in startups (to design the first system in an extensible and ‚Äúgrowable‚Äù way). During the talk, Sandro mentioned a book that is on my ‚Äúto read‚Äù bookshelf, ‚Äú<a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book"  target="_blank" >Team Topologies</a>‚Äù. Employing an outside-in perspective allows in the end to define these topologies in advance, allowing the system to grow organically and without breaking everything on each iteration.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs all for today‚Äôs post! Thank you for reading (if anyone is reading this ü§î) and see you next time!</p>

        <p>Hi! üëã</p>
<p>Today I will write about a meetup I attended this December, hosted by XPUGBg (Extreme Programming User Group Bergamo). The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/xpugbg/"  target="_blank" >XPUGBg</a> is an association promoting and organizing events related to extreme programming in the Bergamo region.</p>
<p>In this meetup, the guests (Marco Consolaro and Alessandro Di Gioia from <a href="https://alcor.academy/"  target="_blank" >Alcor Academy</a>) performed a live mob programming session with the audience, to solve the <a href="https://github.com/makomweb/mars-rover"  target="_blank" >mars rover kata</a>. We learned how to do mob programming, and how the Outside-In TDD approach works.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-extreme-programming">What is Extreme Programming?</h2>
<p>Extreme programming (XP) is a set of values, principles and practices introduced by Kent Beck at the end of the 1990s. Its goals are to improve the software quality and the team&rsquo;s responsiveness to requirements changing during development. I might write my opinions on this methodology in a new blog post, but for now, I‚Äôll redirect you to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658"  target="_blank" >book</a>, which definitely explains it better than I do üòâ.</p>
<p>I discovered extreme programming later this year while attending the XPUG meetups. I also read Kent Beck‚Äôs book and I‚Äôm actively trying to introduce some practices (like TDD and pair programming) into my current team, but I‚Äôm still far from a full XP practitioner. Still, the argument is really interesting.</p>
<p>How does it apply to this meetup? We followed a practice called <strong>mob programming</strong>, in which there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>driver</strong> (Alessandro), the developer actually writing code on the editor</li>
<li>the <strong>navigator</strong>, which instructs the driver on what to write (and sometimes also how)</li>
<li>the <strong>mob</strong>, other members of the team which can discuss with the navigator to improve the code, find possible issues and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>during the meetup, Marco and Alessandro proposed an extended approach (called <strong>fish bowl</strong>), in which the mob is composed of 5 members of the audience, which rotate after some time. So, in addition to the standard mob, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>facilitator</strong> (Marco) guiding the mob and the navigator and deciding when to rotate roles and members</li>
<li>the <strong>audience</strong>, watching it all. Anyone can then enter the fish bowl when he thinks he can give something to the discussion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-kata">What is a Kata?</h2>
<p>‚ÄúKata‚Äù is a term borrowed from martial arts. It is ‚Äúa detailed¬†choreographed
¬†pattern of movements made to be practised alone. It can also be reviewed within groups and in unison when training‚Äù (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata"  target="_blank" >Wikipedia</a>).
Developers have taken this term and applied it to their set of movements, which are coding, testing and designing. A kata is a short problem/exercise meant to be practised a lot of times. The same kata can be practised with different languages, approaches and methodologies, giving each time a new perspective.</p>
<p>In our case, in this meetup, we practised the mars rover kata, and the twists were to practice it with <strong>mob programming</strong> and <strong>outside-in TDD</strong>. Double trouble!</p>
<p>In the mars rover kata, you have to implement a rover moving on the surface of mars. You are given the initial coordinates of the rover (x, y) and the initial orientation (N, S, E, W). Then, you are given the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>L ‚Üí rotate left by 90¬∞</li>
<li>R ‚Üí rotate right by 90¬∞</li>
<li>M ‚Üí move forward one grid point, maintaining the same position</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should output the position of the rover after applying the commands (X, Y coordinates and direction).</p>
<p>During the meetup (because of lack of time and a lot of discussions) we were able to implement only the simplest version, with the rotate left and move forward commands, and without the I/O translation code (from a text file to actual commands and positions). This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the kata was a failure. On the contrary, it was very useful to see different opinions and approaches to the problem at hand.</p>
<h2 id="outside-in-approach">Outside-In approach</h2>
<p><strong>Outside-in</strong> is an approach to develop software in tandem with TDD. It works by starting from the outer layer (‚Äùoutside‚Äù) and, guided by tests, creating the underlying layers (‚Äùin‚Äù) of the software.</p>
<p>In practice, the mob started (guided by marco) with the acceptance tests, the outermost layer of testing. These tests should be in a language understandable by the business, as they indicate whether the problem is solved from the business perspective. The first consideration is that the acceptance tests used the actual input and output strings to test the behaviour of the system (see <a href="https://github.com/makomweb/mars-rover"  target="_blank" >here</a> for the example). This meant that the code needed a sort of ‚Äútranslator‚Äù to translate the inputs to domain objects, and the domain objects to outputs.</p>
<p>The outside-in approach turned out to be difficult to assimilate because it turned my perception of the design upside-down. Starting from the acceptance tests, it was difficult to turn the tests green, and we had to dive deeper and create a lot of code (first the rover controller, then the rover, then the position with coordinates and direction, and so on) before passing our first test.</p>
<p>In addition, we had to use mocks immediately to avoid writing the translator. Marco presented this to us as a challenge: most of the business value and complexity actually resides in the rover code, not the I/O, so it was a good way to concentrate on the core features of the kata.</p>
<p>In the end, we were able to turn our first test green, and it was already time to head to the pub, so‚Ä¶ the rest was left as an exercise for the viewers üòá.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The meetup was really interesting, and it helped me learn new concepts. Even if I didn‚Äôt participate in the mob but just watched, I exercised my ‚Äúdesign muscles‚Äù during the session and my brain was always comparing alternatives and thinking about the code.</p>
<p>Marco and Alessandro are great teachers: Marco was a great facilitator and guided the mob to the right solution, while Alessandro was a thoughtful driver with opinions, also helping the mob to cooperate.</p>
<p>The outside-in approach was new for most of the audience, and even experienced developers discussed how to design the solution and how to proceed. They created a lot of classes seemingly ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù at the moment, but later it all made sense. This is quite different from standard TDD, in which you just write the code needed to pass the tests and then refactor. Outside-In helps to reduce the refactoring stage, which always leads to rewriting big chunks of the code.</p>
<p>Finally, I never tried practising a kata. I think it is a really useful technique to learn new concepts with a known problem, and I‚Äôll use it more in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now üéâ. Thank you for reading and see you next time!.</p>
