Like every blogger out there, it‚Äôs time to write a ‚Äú2022 Wrap-Up‚Äù! In this (short) post, I‚Äôll give a recap of what happened last year, and write down my goals for 2023.
So, let‚Äôs start!
Disclaimer: This recap is mostly written by me and for me. I don‚Äôt expect it to be a beautifully written and engaging piece for other people. It might get boring, you‚Äôve been warned.</description></item><item><title>XPUGBg December meetup: ‚ÄúMars Rover Kata, an outside-in approach‚Äù</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/2022-dec-mars-rover-kata-meetup/</guid><description>Hi! üëã
Today I will write about a meetup I attended this December, hosted by XPUGBg (Extreme Programming User Group Bergamo). The XPUGBg is an association promoting and organizing events related to extreme programming in the Bergamo region.
In this meetup, the guests (Marco Consolaro and Alessandro Di Gioia from Alcor Academy) performed a live mob programming session with the audience, to solve the mars rover kata. We learned how to do mob programming, and how the Outside-In TDD approach works.</description></item><item><title>Remote working?</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 18:36:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/blog/remote-work-opinions/</guid><description>Hi! Welcome to my first post on this blog, I hope there will be others soon!
Today I felt inspired after reading an article from Bennet Garner (here). He writes every day in his newsletter about software development and finding purpose in your job/life. I‚Äôll try to follow his advice and write regularly, but for sure I cannot promise anything like a daily post.
By the way, Bennet‚Äôs article is about remote working: its pros, cons and why it‚Äôs going to last in our society.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/about/</guid><description>Who? Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Marco and this is my personal website, where I&amp;rsquo;m going to put informations about me and what I do (and some blog posts when I&amp;rsquo;ll feel creative).
I started programming when I was 12 (just a tiny little bullied nerd in middle school) with the classic web stack known as LAMP (üí°). High school and hobbies (guitar first, then photography) kicked in at 14 and I lost touch with web development (does VB.</description></item><item><title>Curriculum Vitae</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/cv/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/cv/</guid><description>For the boring and ugly pdf version click here.

It consists in an FPGA-accelerated application for retinal vessels segmentation, which aims at improving the performance (speed) of screening tests.
Context Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disorder due to diabetes compensation, and consists in the rapid growth of new anomalous vessels in the retina micro-circulation and the creation of micro-aneurysm and exudates or hemorrhages.</description></item><item><title>CONDOR</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/condor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/condor/</guid><description>CONDOR (Convolutional neural network Dataflow Optimization using Reconfigurable hardware) is a project started in Novmber 2016 and that I left in May 2018, which aims at creating a scalable and easy-to-use framework to accelerate convolutional neural networks using FPGAs in the cloud.
Abstract From the last published paper (May 2018):
&amp;ldquo;The recent years have seen a rapid diffusion of deep learning algorithms as Convolutional Neural Networks, and as a consequence, an intensification of industrial and academic research focused on optimizing their implementation.</description></item><item><title>DiSPosE</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/dispose/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/dispose/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/</guid><description>üéÑ Advent Of Code Solutions (github) Last year (2021) I tried solving some Advent of code challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun way to write some code in the free time.
In 2021 I solved some challenges (up until day 18, then I went on vacation and completely forgot about it üòÖ) using python.
This time (2022) I&amp;rsquo;m solving them using Rust (Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m learning it while solving the challeges, so it will be ugly!</description></item></channel></rss>
