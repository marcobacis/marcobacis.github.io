Welcome to my first post on this blog, I hope there will be others soon!
Today I felt inspired after reading an article from Bennet Garner (here). He writes every day in his newsletter about software development and finding purpose in your job/life. Iâ€™ll try to follow his advice and write regularly, but for sure I cannot promise anything like a daily post.
By the way, Bennetâ€™s article is about remote working: its pros, cons and why itâ€™s going to last in our society.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/about/</guid><description>Who? Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Marco and this is my personal website, where I&amp;rsquo;m going to put informations about me and what I do (and some blog posts when I&amp;rsquo;ll feel creative).
I started programming when I was 12 (just a tiny little bullied nerd in middle school) with the classic web stack known as LAMP (ðŸ’¡). High school and hobbies (guitar first, then photography) kicked in at 14 and I lost touch with web development (does VB.</description></item><item><title>Curriculum Vitae</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/cv/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/cv/</guid><description>For the boring and ugly pdf version click here.
Experience Milan, Italy Sep. 2019 - ???

It consists in an FPGA-accelerated application for retinal vessels segmentation, which aims at improving the performance (speed) of screening tests.
Context Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disorder due to diabetes compensation, and consists in the rapid growth of new anomalous vessels in the retina micro-circulation and the creation of micro-aneurysm and exudates or hemorrhages.</description></item><item><title>CONDOR</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/condor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/condor/</guid><description>CONDOR (Convolutional neural network Dataflow Optimization using Reconfigurable hardware) is a project started in Novmber 2016 and that I left in May 2018, which aims at creating a scalable and easy-to-use framework to accelerate convolutional neural networks using FPGAs in the cloud.
Abstract From the last published paper (May 2018):
&amp;ldquo;The recent years have seen a rapid diffusion of deep learning algorithms as Convolutional Neural Networks, and as a consequence, an intensification of industrial and academic research focused on optimizing their implementation.</description></item><item><title>DiSPosE</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/dispose/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/dispose/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcobacis.com/static/projects/</guid><description>Past Research Projects These projects have been developed (and, as all master student research projects, never continued after first completion) during my MSc years at Politecnico di Milano.
BlastFunction BlastFunction is the project I developed for my master thesis at Politecnico di Milano. Given the recent growing interest for heterogeneous computing and custom hardware accelerators, there have been a lot of work integrating FPGAs and cloud environments. However, these devices are still treated as separate entities in the current scenario, meaning that they are used in conjunction with Virtual Machines, but are kept out of container and serverless applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
